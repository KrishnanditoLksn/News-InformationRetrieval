      "\n",
      "By Chris Isidore, CNN\n",
      "\n",
      "Elliott Investment Management announced Monday it has taken a $1.9 billion stake in Southwest Airlines and said there needs to be new leadership at the Dallas-based carrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Southwest’s poor execution and leadership’s stubborn unwillingness to evolve the company’s strategy have led to deeply disappointing results for shareholders, employees and customers alike,” said the statement from the firm. “Southwest’s rigid commitment to a decades-old approach has inhibited its ability to compete in the modern airline industry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The letter pointed out that Southwest’s share price is down more than 50% from early 2021 and now trades at a price lower than its pre-pandemic price in 2020. Southwest (LUV) stock gained more than 6% in trading Monday on the news of Elliott’s letter to the Southwest Board.\n",
      "\n",
      "The airline has been particularly hurt by the fact that it only flies the Boeing 737 jet, and that the promised deliveries of the jets in at least the next year will be delayed by safety and production problems. It has been forced to freeze hiring of pilots as it will take delivery of only 20 of the 79 promised jets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ellioitt’s letter made no mention of a desire to change Southwest from an all-737 fleet, which would increase the cost of pilot training and spare parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Boeing has caused problems for Southwest, some have been self-inflicted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The carrier suffered massive operational problems during the year-end holiday travel period in 2022, causing it to cancel 16,700 flights between December 21 and 29 that year, or nearly half of its schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meltdown was attributed to antiquated staff scheduling software that made it difficult to recover from bad weather at the start of the period. The disruptions cost it more than $1 billion in passenger compensation, increased pay for staff and lost ticketing revenue, in addition to a $140 million fine by the Department of Transportation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its letter does not give details about the changes it wants to see, other than a change in leadership at the airline. It did say the management company wants to see “increased customer choice, improved cost execution and updating outdated IT systems, among other opportunities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Southwest said it was only contacted by Elliott on Sunday. It said it looks “forward to better understanding their views on our company.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Southwest board of directors is confident in our CEO and management’s ability to execute against the company’s strategic plan to drive long-term value for all shareholders, safely and reliably serve our customers and deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders,” it added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Florida-based Elliott, whose web site said it managed about $65.5 billion in assets at the end of last year, was founded in 1977. It recently disclosed a similar $2.5 billion position in Texas Instruments and has reportedly made invests in Softbank and Johnson Controls recently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Southwest is the one airline that does not have seat reservation for its passengers. CEO Bob Jordan told investors last month that the airline is “seriously studying” a possible change to that policy.\n",

      "Apple, facing tariffs on Chinese imports, says it will invest $500 billion in US facilities\n",
      "By Chris Isidore and Clare Duffy, CNN\n",
      "\n",
      "New York\n",
      "CNN\n",
      " — \n",
      "Apple said Monday it will invest $500 billion on expanding US facilities over the next four years, a move that could help it avoid new tariffs on goods imported from China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple said the investment will create 20,000 jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this month, President Donald Trump announced tariffs of 10% on all imports from China, from which Apple imports many products, including most of its iPhones. Trump signaled Friday that the company was planning to make this investment following a meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook on Thursday. Trump attributed the investment to his tariffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s investing hundreds of billions of dollars, I hope he’s announced it,” Trump said. “That’s what he told me … But he’s investing hundreds of billions of dollars. And others, too, a lot of chip makers coming in, a lot of automakers coming in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the investment builds on Apple’s previous efforts to expand its supply chain outside of China in recent years, partly in response to production issues in China during the pandemic. Those investments include growing production for Mac Pro computers in Texas.\n",
      "\n",
      "TSMC, which makes chips for Apple, has also recently opened chipmaking plant in Arizona, helped by $6.6 billion in support from a bipartisan bill passed during the Biden administration to encourage investment in US chip manufacturing. However, Apple has mostly expanded production in places like India and Vietnam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the US investment could help Apple avoid the cost of Trump’s new tariffs. Although it will be a while before the new facilities are operational and the bulk of Apple’s manufacturing will continue to occur overseas, the announcement could help the company curry favor with the president. And that could be useful if Apple seeks an exemption to the China tariffs, as it did during Trump’s prior term.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing US investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,” said Cook in a statement from the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump thanked Cook and Apple for the announcement in an all-caps post on Truth Social early Monday, in which he took credit for the decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The reason, faith in what we are doing, without witch (sic), they wouldn’t be investing ten cents,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "White House trade counselor Peter Navarro wouldn’t rule out a tariff exemption for Apple on iPhone and other electronics imports from China, when asked by CNN on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s always President Trump’s decision,” he said in an appearance on CNN News Central. Asked if he would support such an exemption, he refused to voice an opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I always let the boss do his thing,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Navarro defended the administration’s imposition of new tariffs and threats of additional tariffs since taking office, and he echoed Trump’s claim that the tariffs are the reason why Apple agreed to make the US investment in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re just going to see hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars now across different industries and sectors coming into this country, investing here instead of Tim Cook going to China like he’s had too much of a penchant to do for far too long,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple’s US investment won’t directly circumvent the China tariffs, said Angelo Zino, equity analyst at CFRA research. But “we think it will at least put the company in the good graces of the new administration should exemptions be on the table,” Zino said in emailed commentary following the Monday announcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investment\n",
      "Apple doesn’t do much of its own manufacturing, largely using contractors instead. The company said it will work with thousands of manufacturing partners spread across all 50 states to produce more products in US facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "That includes a new server production facility in Houston that it said will support Apple Intelligence, the company’s brand of artificial intelligence products. Apple said the 250,000-square-foot server manufacturing facility, slated to open in 2026, will create thousands of jobs. The servers, previously manufactured outside of the United States, are a core to its artificial intelligence efforts, the company said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The servers bring together years of R&D by Apple engineers,” it said in its statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple said part of the investment will create an academy in Detroit to train small- and medium-sized businesses on implementing AI and smart manufacturing techniques. And the company will double its investment in its US Advanced Manufacturing Fund to $10 billion to promote “advanced manufacturing and skills development throughout the country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It will also expand data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona and Nevada, and plans to invest in corporate facilities and production of Apple TV+ shows in 20 states.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least some of these efforts were likely underway prior to Monday. And the announcement echoes similar promises Apple made during the two previous administrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, weeks after Biden’s inauguration, Apple said it would invest $430 billion in the United States over five years and create 20,000 new jobs, including construction of a new campus in North Carolina, which has reportedly been paused. And in January 2018, Apple said it would invest $350 billion in the United States over five years and create 20,000 jobs, including by growing US data center capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple did not immediately respond to a question about whether any of the promised investment dollars or new jobs announced Monday had also been included in prior announcements.\n",

      "AT&T to invest $2B in mobile network\n",
      "By Marguerite Reardon\n",
      "\n",
      "(CNET) -- AT&T said Thursday that it will invest an additional $2 billion in its network in 2010 to make sure it keeps up with the growing demand from new smartphones and other 3G data devices, such as the Apple iPad, on its network.\n",
      "\n",
      "During its fourth quarter 2009 conference call, Chief Operating Officer John Stankey said AT&T plans to spend between $18 billion and $19 billion in 2010 upgrading its wireless and backhaul networks to handle the onslaught of new traffic. This is roughly $2 billion more than the company had invested in the previous year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, Stankey said AT&T will add 2,000 new cell sites and upgrade existing cell sites with three times more fiber links than it had in 2009. This will increase capacity for the backhaul network that connects the cell towers to AT&T's main network. The backhaul portion of the network is a critical component to AT&T's network; with these upgrades in place, Stankey said the company will be able to easily upgrade in the future to 4G wireless technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "AT&T will begin testing its 4G network using LTE, the same technology Verizon Wireless is using for its 4G network, starting in 2010, with a few commercial deployments ready in 2011 and more commercial deployments in 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "AT&T, which is the only wireless operator in the U.S. selling the iPhone, has been the target of much criticism over this past year, as many iPhone subscribers, particularly in densely populated urban areas, have complained about dropped calls, slow Internet access, and poor all around service. Some critics claim the company has not been spending enough on network upgrades to keep up with growing demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stankey acknowledged that AT&T has faced some difficulties, particularly in cities like New York and San Francisco. But he said the company is \"closing the gap.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He said there are periods of time during the week in some sections of Manhattan where nearly 70 percent of the phones active on its network are data-intensive devices. He said to deal with this surge in usage, AT&T is increasing 3G radio capacity in those trouble areas by more than one third. The company will also add additional radio network controllers on existing cell sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for San Francisco, Stankey blamed the poor network performance on zoning issues that have prevented the company from getting new cell phone towers up. But he said the company was been working to resolve these issues. And AT&T expects to add new cell towers in the Bay Area in 2010. And it's boosting capacity at convention centers, sports stadiums and along public transportation routes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But keeping up with demand on AT&T's network is a bit like shooting a moving target. Usage on the network keeps increasing as AT&T adds new devices and subscribers. In the fourth quarter, AT&T added 2.7 million new mobile subscribers. Overall usage on AT&T's network grew 200 percent in 2009 alone. And the company is now servicing more than twice the number of smartphones as its competitors; again, it is the exclusive carrier in the U.S. for the iPhone, one of the most data intensive devices on the market. And in the fourth quarter, AT&T activated an additional 3.1 million iPhones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company is also adding even more smartphones to its lineup as well as other data intensive devices, that will eat up bandwidth. In January at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, AT&T said it would soon offer two Palm smartphones and several Google Android handsets this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday, Apple announced that AT&T will be the exclusive carrier to provide 3G wireless service to the new iPad tablet. Many Apple fans and industry watchers groaned at this news, suggesting that if AT&T can't handle the iPhone it won't be able to the iPad.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Stankey said AT&T has already made significant progress in upgrading its network in the fourth quarter and will continue to make upgrades in 2010 to keep up with demand. He also said that much of the usage on the iPad will be offloaded to Wi-Fi hotspots, which will not affect AT&T's 3G network.\n",

      "Bitcoin evangelists are confident it will keep climbing as they anticipate a friendlier regulatory environment under the new administration. Many think bitcoin is a great tool to build generational wealth. And some are even advocating for the US to create a strategic bitcoin reserve, which MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor told CNBC is a way for the US to “buy the future.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first decade after bitcoin’s creation in 2009, the financial planning world was reluctant to consider crypto assets as a serious option for most individual investors. But in the past few years, education about crypto assets has been made more available to professionals. For example, the Financial Planning Association now offers three continuing education courses on crypto, according to FPA president-elect Paul Brahim.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it’s easy to wonder if maybe it’s time to consider investing in bitcoin. We reached out to some financial advisers to see what guidance they offer clients interested in doing so for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you’d be investing in\n",
      "Bitcoin is the oldest and best known of all crypto coins. Its creator — the ever-anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto — set things up so that there can never be more than 21 million bitcoins in existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike other assets that are valued based on tangible components — for example, a company’s goods and services or a natural resource — bitcoin is considered a store of value, the price of which depends strictly on what others are willing to pay for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its pricing is highly volatile — and therefore highly risky. For all its nosebleed ascents, bitcoin also has had some gut-punching plunges. Between November 2021 and November 2022, for example, the price of bitcoin dropped 75%, from $64,455 to $16,196, according to data on coinmarketcap.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it’s called a currency — and in some instances can be used like money — bitcoin is not legal tender in the United States or most other countries. And it is a much more complicated transaction for the individual who uses it to buy and sell things, especially when it comes to reporting the transactions on their taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its role in your portfolio\n",
      "When asked what role bitcoin might play in a person’s overall financial investment and savings portfolio — which you might use to buy a house, start a family, pay for college or save for retirement — one strong area of consensus among planners is to not invest any money in bitcoin for anything you must do in the next five years.\n",

      "“Due to its volatility, I would definitely avoid using bitcoin for short-term savings goals. And for the same reason, I would recommend only allocating a very small percentage of my long-term investment strategy to it,” said Trent Porter, a certified financial planner and certified public accountant at Priority Financial Partners. He advises his clients who insist on exposure to limit their portfolio allocation to bitcoin to no more than 5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "CFP Mike Turi, a founding partner of Upbeat Wealth who is also an accredited portfolio management adviser, is more conservative. He doesn’t recommend clients allocate more than 3% to bitcoin, if they allocate any at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would not recommend using bitcoin as the main strategy to achieve your financial goals. If it’s extra investable money that can help you get there faster? Sure. However, don’t miss out on valuable opportunities by overexposing yourself to an asset that you might not fully understand,” Turi said.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Pulse Financial Planning CFP Matt Elliott’s perspective, tax-advantaged 529 plans will always be the better option for college because they can be diversified and carry less risk. “It is one thing to bet your money on crypto, but another to bet a child’s college savings on it,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elliott, however, can see a small role for bitcoin in a long-term retirement portfolio. He recommends his clients use a “core and explore” strategy. “Ninety-five percent of your assets should be in a core, well-diversified portfolio that is designed with your timeframe and risk tolerance in mind. The other 5% can be used for more speculative investments (such as crypto) if you have little debt and are willing to accept the risk of losing what you put in,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Questions to ask yourself before buying bitcoin\n",
      "Whether bitcoin make sense for you depends as much on your circumstances and preferences as it does on the facts of the asset itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Before you invest in bitcoin for any reason, ask yourself if it were to drop 50% or more, would you be left in a pinch? If the answer is yes, you should reconsider,” said Porter, who notes that even if regulatory risk does go down for crypto assets during the Trump administration “by no means has the overall risk changed significantly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Turi suggests getting real with what you’ll be able to live with. “I still see bitcoin more as a gamble than a reliable investment. Is it a risk you can afford to take? Consult your future self. What will happen if it doesn’t work out?” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you do invest, set some ground rules for yourself from the jump. “The most challenging aspect of the bitcoin craze is that more retail investors are entering the market at its peak when euphoria is highest,” Turi said. “On the flip side, they’ve never really established an exit strategy. …Investors need to set their exit price to avoid being driven by emotion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Low-risk way to invest in a high-risk asset\n",
      "If you decide you do want to put some money into bitcoin, you can buy it directly and store it either in your own virtual wallet or on a digital asset platform like Coinbase. But both options can get complicated and carry risks. [Here is a long list of storage options and their pros and cons.]\n",

      "Before the Bell: What do higher-for-longer rates mean for the stock market?\n",
      "\n",
      "The stock market is always forward-looking, and I think the market may have already priced in the fewer rate cuts [before the Fed meeting]. As we’ve seen throughout the year, the expectation for rate cuts has been steadily declining.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I find interesting and actually kind of invigorating is the resilience of the US economy in the face of these expected higher-for-longer rates. I think that we expected, consistent with most financial economists and investors, higher rates to really begin biting the economy more quickly and more significantly last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it turns out, I think our new hypothesis, based on everything we’ve seen, is that these higher-for-longer rates are really just a return to a more normal rate environment, sort of a pre-global financial crisis rate environment.\n",

      "There will be some sectors that higher-for-longer rates will impact. And we’ve already seen some of them. For example, real estate. Most real estate is financed. Commercial real estate in particular, offices and retail, I think will continue to suffer. We’ve seen that already, and I think there’s probably still some more pain to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another area like cars, the big purchases that many consumers finance. Obviously, higher-for-longer rates makes that financing more expensive. And so we can see consumer durables slowing down or suffering a little bit in this higher-for-longer rate environment.\n",

      "\n",
      "Semiconductors, those we think will continue to do well. They’ve almost become the new defensives because they have so much cash on their balance sheet.

      "\n",
      "Higher-yielding bonds might also be an attractive option, Wilson said.\n",
      "\n",

      "And if their exposure falls below their initial allocation, Sterling wants them to leave it be. “In other words, if bitcoin was 3% of a client’s allocation and [it fell to] 1% … I am advising them to … not rebalance back to 3%.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Whether you’re a saver or you recently inherited a small windfall, you have many options if you have $50,000 — or any amount of money — to invest in 2023. We asked two financial experts for their best advice on how to invest $50,000 right now. Their answers may surprise you.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The short answer is it depends,” says Sylvia Kwan, chief investment officer at Ellevest. “The best place to invest right now depends on your financial situation and goals. That said, if you have high-interest debt, you shouldn’t be investing, you should pay down your debt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s look at some of your options.\n",

      "Paying down debts early means you save money on interest charges. iStock\n",
      "With interest rates higher than they’ve been in years, it’s no surprise that both experts we spoke to expressed the same sentiment about wiping down debt first and foremost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming high-interest debt is not an issue, Kwan says the next thing to do is make sure you have an emergency fund with three to nine months’ worth of expenses and make sure it’s fully liquid in a bank, savings, or money market fund where you can access it. “As rates have gone up, that money can earn 4 to 5 percent in a money market fund.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning and wealth management at Schwab, agrees. “A money market fund is a great, stable investment that won’t rise and fall as much [as other investments] but it will generate payments.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If you do have debt and can’t pay it off immediately, consider opening a balance transfer credit card with a promotional 0% APR offer. This will give you extra time to pay down your debt without interest charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "One great option is the U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card. This card gives you a 0% intro APR on new purchases and balance transfers for the first 18 billing cycles (then a variable 18.74% - 29.74% APR). Plus, you’ll get free cell phone insurance if you pay your monthly phone bill with the card.\n",

      "\n",
      "If you don’t think you’ll need the money within one year but you may want to access it in less than five, a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds is both Williams’ and Kwan’s best advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, you can earn well over 5.0% APY with CDs. For example, Quontic — an online bank — is offering 5.30% APY on one-year CDs. Or if you’d prefer a more traditional bank, Barclays offers 5.50% APY its one-year CDs, at the time of writing.\n",

      "\n",
      "One of our favorite savings accounts — UFB High Yield Savings — is currently offering a high 5.25% APY on deposits. However, this rate can change at any time, unlike a CD which locks in a set interest rate for the duration of the deposit.\n",

      "“Think about investments as building blocks, and there are three big ones: cash/cash investments, bonds, and stocks,” Williams says. “Cash and cash investments have guaranteed and relatively stable returns; then you have bonds, which have become increasingly attractive because of inflation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bonds pay interest rates that adjust with inflation, but there are limits to how much you can invest and they’re not fixed, which means the rate of return can go down or up. “There’s no locking it in,” says Williams.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re in it for the long term, stocks can be an a good investment because they provide the greatest potential for growth and appreciation. But to reap the highest rewards, you have to be willing to do your own research and part with the money for some time. And remember, stocks can lose value too.\n",

      "“With $50,000 you can get a diversified portfolio of EFTs that are tax efficient and relatively low cost,” Williams says. “The funds are selected by a research team and swapped out when they find they like one better than the other.

      "\n",
      "Investing in real estate is a good option if your credit is good enough to borrow the balance after your down payment, especially if you think you’ll hold on to the asset for at least three to five years. This allows you to refinance your interest rate if rates start trending downward.\n",

People sit on the sidelines for a variety of reasons, but weeks become months and then years and you lose out on compounding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The second mistake potential investors make is getting easily distracted by the headlines. “Whether it’s a Bitcoin comeback, T bills, or whatever the next shiny thing is, people gravitate,” Kwan says. “Investing shouldn’t be exciting, it should be boring because that’s what has always worked in the long term.”\n",

      "March has been a dizzying month for US markets. The S&P 500 just posted two days of back-to-back gains, but the benchmark index is still down almost 5% this month.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements have roiled markets and sent US stocks bouncing all over the place. While the uncertainty on Wall Street can be unsettling, selling your stocks in panic would likely only make it worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although recent market swings can be daunting, market volatility is more normal than you’d think, according to Jeff Buchbinder, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial.\n",

      "“Volatility is like a toll investors pay on the road to attractive long-term returns,” Buchbinder said in a recent note.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last thing you want to do is “panic sell.” Volatility is a short-term feature of markets. So, too, are so-called corrections, when stocks fall 10% from their most recent high.\n",

      "Historically, the US stock market has climbed higher in the long term, smoothing out kinks and rewarding investors who stayed in the market.\n",

      "\n",
      "“I’ve been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy,” Bessent said. “They’re normal. What’s not healthy is straight up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, seeing your retirement account take a hit can be unnerving, especially given the whiplash of recent market swings. But if you’re investing for retirement or long-term financial goals, the best thing to do during moments of uncertainty is to keep calm and tune out the noise.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Panic selling often means locking in losses and missing the best rebound days,” Ulin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A core tenet of investing is that no one can really “time” the market. Swings can be so unpredictable that staying invested is a better strategy than selling and trying to pick the best opportunity to get back into a fund or stock you sold. People who sell when times are tough tend to lose out in the long run.\n",

      "\n",
      "Trump’s whipsawing tariff proposals are the primary reason for the markets’ rollercoaster ride, because they have created an environment of uncertainty. US stocks have slid amid the ensuing economic chaos, with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite largely erasing their gains since the election.\n",

      "The benchmark S&P 500 on March 13 closed in correction, down 10% from its high in February. Richard Drew/AP\n",
      "Stocks on average see one correction a year, according to Buchbinder. Before the S&P 500 closed in correction territory last week, it had been over a year since its last correction. If you’re planning to hold your investments long term, such drops in one year don’t necessarily matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heading into this year, US stocks had been at record highs, with some strategists questioning whether they were overvalued. The S&P 500 posted back-to-back gains of more than 20% in 2023 and 2024 — a feat not achieved since President Bill Clinton was in office in the 1990s.\n",
      "\n",
      "After those sky-high gains, investors were already uncertain whether the good times would last. Big tech stocks that propped up the S&P 500 in 2024 have sputtered this year. While downturns are frustrating, they also present opportunities to “buy the dip” and purchase stocks while they are cheaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Encouragingly, history hints (but does not guarantee) that quick drops below the 10% decline threshold typically resulted in shorter and shallower total declines, followed by more rapid recoveries,” Stovall said in a note Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Unfortunately, the greatest uncertainty surrounding this decline and possible recovery is that its major headwind — the tariff tiff — appears far from over,” Stovall added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diversification is key to weathering the storm\n",
      "While markets face continued tariff uncertainty, it can be helpful to return to investing 101.\n",
      "\n",
      "A portfolio that is well-diversified across different types of stocks and bonds can help you mitigate losses during market swings. That becomes especially apparent during times of heightened volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Spreading risk across different asset classes, sectors and regions is investing 101,” Ulin said. “Think of diversification as your portfolio’s seatbelt, keeping you secure when markets hit rough air.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If your portfolio is overexposed to US stocks, it might be smart to consider buying stocks in global markets like Europe and to further diversify by investing in Treasury bonds. Diversification might also look like investing in stocks in industries that have less exposure to tariffs, or “tariff-proofing” your portfolio, Ulin said.\n",

      "That’s an important distinction from assuming they won’t be paid back in full, Martin notes. The assumption is that even if the United States briefly goes past the X-date, it will resolve things quickly and will make good on all the payments it must make. In contrast to corporate debt, the risk is that a bond investor would only be able to recover a portion of their investment. “But with Treasuries, it’s more about ‘When will I get the money back?’” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, yields on one-month T bills are well above the yields for 10-year and 30-year Treasury bonds. For bills maturing on or before May 30, yields have fallen and their prices have risen because investors are willing to pay up to have a near guarantee of prompt repayment, Martin noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what, if anything, should bond investors do now?\n",
      "Those who have invested in Treasury bills maturing on or right after June 1 and who definitely need their money at that time — for example, to pay their own bills — might consider selling those bills now and reinvesting in bills that mature sooner, Martin suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re invested in bond funds, check to see that the bond portion of your portfolio has adequate exposure to intermediate and longer-term bonds, rather than being too heavily weighted toward short-term higher yielding bonds. With the latter, “you face reinvestment risk down the road when it might be better to lock in rates with certainty now,” he said. Those rates are currently running between 3.5% to 4%.\n",
      "\n",
      "And to the extent there is any uncertainty about being paid on time by the Treasury, there may be a flight to 10-year Treasury bonds — which means their prices will go up, which can help buffer your portfolio. “They are still the most liquid investment and the safest investment out there,” Martin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to your exposure to bonds other than Treasuries, Martin recommends sticking more heavily with high-quality investments, rather than corporate junk bonds or emerging market bonds. The reason: If the economy turns south — or the unthinkable happens and the United States does default on its debt — those high-risk debt instruments will come under the most pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you need to borrow money, you need the confidence of the markets to lend to you,” Martin said. If there is a recession or any concern about the Treasury paying back investors on time, there will be less confidence to go around.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for your 401(k), Martin said the best thing you can do now is to review your equity-to-bond allocation and make adjustments if necessary. As we move closer to June, stocks are likely to see a lot more volatility because they are inherently riskier assets than bonds.\n",

      "Considering the longer-term picture for your investments is also the advice from Vanguard, according to spokesperson Jessica Schifalacqua.\n",

      "\n",
      "The investigation came after a report from short-seller Hindenburg Research sent shares in Icahn’s investment firm spiraling last year. Hindenburg wrote that “Icahn has been using money taken in from new investors to pay out dividends to old investors. Such Ponzi-like economic structures are sustainable only to the extent that new money is willing to risk being the last one ‘holding the bag.’”\n",

      "“These disclosures would have revealed that Icahn pledged over half of IEP’s outstanding shares at any given time,” said Osman Nawaz, head of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Complex Financial Instruments Unit, in a statement Monday. That left existing and prospective investors “deprived of required information.”\n",

      "Faltering tech stocks, fears that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates higher for longer and geopolitical conflict have led to a sharp drop in US markets this month. CNN’s Fear & Greed Index, which measures seven barometers of market sentiment, is displaying a solid “fear” reading, down from “greed” just a month ago.\n",

      "But Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak, Boston Consulting Group’s global chief economist, thinks there’s too much doomsaying on Wall Street. The economy has been extraordinarily resilient for the past few years — consistently proving the naysayers wrong, he says. For all of the market gloom last week, stocks are still near all-time highs, and this earnings season has been strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carlsson-Szlezak, who co-authored a book on pervasive economic doomsaying, told Before the Bell that the Federal Reserve’s wait-and-see approach to inflation and interest rate cuts should be a vote of confidence for this economy and that recession fears are far off from reality.\n",

      "Before the Bell: You literally wrote the book on economic doomsaying. Investors have been worrying about the Federal Reserve keeping rates higher for longer. Are their fears overblown?\n",
      "\n",
      "Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak: We’re seeing expectations reset — the forecast for six rate cuts this year has vanished, now it’s less than two. The fact that markets are off about 4% relative to that news is not out of the ordinary.\n",
      "\n",
      "These inflation prints are actually an extreme expression of underlying strength. The vanishing rate cut expectations, well, they’re also an expression of strength. If we had to rush to cut rates to prop up the economy, that would be bad. We can wait because this economy is booming and running ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The market volatility, in my view, is a confirmation that those rate cuts aren’t coming as fast as was hoped and dreamed about.\n",
      "\n",
      "But valuations are very high, and the markets are still near record highs. I speak with many institutional investors, and I don’t see them folding in fear. I think the market would look different if that were the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about geopolitical worries? \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s so easy to focus on predictions of a dire meltdown. We have a war in Europe, that is an enormous shift in the geopolitical landscape, an enormous humanitarian shock and an enormous disruption to the European business order. And there is no recession. Isn’t that telling us something about how high the bar can be for geopolitics to flow directly through to the macroeconomy?\n",
      "\n",
      "A similar point can be made about rising tensions in the Middle East. So far, they have not pushed down a major Western economy. They have the potential to do so, and this is the difficulty with geopolitical risk. If that feeds into an oil price rally and a sharp movement in the oil market, we’re talking about something different. But recall that at the start of the Ukraine war, oil also went up a lot. And did we get a recession in the US from that? Did it pull down the growth numbers in the US? It did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not saying there isn’t a risk. And I’m not saying we should look away and shrug off these many geopolitical crises. They all have the potential to magnify and amplify and grow.\n",

      "But it’s not really possible to say that the real economy has taken a hit from either war in either Ukraine or the Middle East.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are investors paying too much attention to swings in monthly economic data? \n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the short-term predictability and forecast ability for the economy is very poor. Economics isn’t really constructed like a natural science in that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I quibble with the notion that markets can’t look through this. As I’ve said, we’re still near record numbers in the equity market. If you believed all the doomsaying about impending stumbles and the economy falling off a cliff edge, then we wouldn’t have these valuations and these prices in various financial markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Markets have to react to something. Somebody prices everything at the margin. Of course there’s a reaction to data flow. But I don’t think, for example, that the three consecutive months of inflation surprises to the upside have pushed the equity market into a reset or a correction.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what comes next? We can’t stave off a cyclical recession forever. \n",
      "\n",
      "When will the next recession be? You and I both know, that’s so hard to pinpoint, but I don’t think it will be in 2024. It would take a big shock to deliver a recession this year.\n",

      "The Dow rose 484 points, or 1.2%, on Monday. The broader S&P 500 rose 1.2% and tech-heavy Nasdaq was also 1.2% higher. At one point earlier in the afternoon, the Dow was up more than 600 points.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s in stark contrast to the mood from last week, when investors punished stocks in the lead-up to what Wall Street predicted would be a less-than-thrilling jobs report.

      "The Fed has kept interest rates high to bring price hikes under control. But there’s an (intended) consequence to rate hikes: They slow the economy down. Rate hikes increase the costs of doing business and hurt profitability. That tends to slow down hiring, which means fewer jobs and less money for consumers to spend. Because consumer spending makes up the vast majority of America’s economy, the Fed almost always plunges the economy into a recession when it hikes rates — although that’s obviously not the goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that America is not in a recession after years of high rates is nothing short of extraordinary. Until recently, hiring kept on booming and consumers kept on spending — largely because pandemic-era stimulus hadn’t quite worn off yet and because many homeowners locked in ultra-low mortgage rates that freed up cash.\n",

      "\n",
      "“April’s turbulence coupled with this still-constructive backdrop for risk-taking does point to an increasingly complex investing environment,” wrote Michael Arone, SPDR chief investment strategist at State Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arone spoke with Before the Bell to outline three things about markets right now “that investors should know, but probably don’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Small- and mid-cap stocks have outperformed large-cap stocks recently.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Magnificent 7 dominance is a myth so far this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Long-duration US Treasuries have delivered negative performance for the first time ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "This interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n",
      "\n",
      "You write that investors might be surprised to hear that small- and mid-cap stocks have outperformed large-cap stocks over the past five months. Why do you think that’s surprising, and what does it say about markets? \n",
      "\n",
      "Most investors think that the S&P 500 has been outperforming everything else, largely dragged up by the performance of the Magnificent 7 (Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia). I think it would be a surprise to many investors that mid-cap and small-cap stocks have actually outperformed since the last time the S&P 500 hit a recent low, which was at the end of October. Ultimately what happened was the (US) Treasury decided to issue Treasury bills instead of longer coupon debt. That started to push interest rates down, and then the Fed suggested that they may cut rates, and that led to this massive rally. The big beneficiaries of that, I think, would be a surprise for most investors — those mid-cap stocks and small-cap stocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right. But things have changed since then, and now we have no idea when the Fed is actually going to cut interest rates. Do you expect small- and mid-cap stocks to continue to outperform or do you see that changing?\n",
      "\n",
      "As that has changed and fewer rate cuts are now expected, the S&P 500 has wrestled back leadership from mid-cap and small-cap stocks. But I think that the Fed will cut rates later in the year, and as that happens, and rates begin to fall, things will revert. It has proven to be a catalyst in the past, and I think it will be in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "So as an investor, I may not know exactly when the Fed is likely to cut rates, but I am confident that it’s coming, and why not buy the stocks when they’re a little bit out of favor and while they’re less expensive than large cap stocks. It gives me an opportunity to diversify away from the Magnificent Seven and invest in something that’s cheaper on a relative basis, and has historically done well as rates fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "You say that market concentration and the Magnificent 7 are myths so far this year. Why is that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, if a market benchmark is weighted based on the market capitalization, it will always be the case that the biggest stocks have the biggest influence on both risk and return. That’s not really news. But when I look at how certain sectors have done so far this year, things like industrials and financials and energy have done better than technology. Communication services has done well, but that’s not a ringing endorsement for the Magnificent 7. When I look at other benchmarks like the EuroStoxx 50, and even some measures of Japanese equities, they’ve done equally as well as the S&P 500 and in some ways a bit better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that there’s a case to be made that, at least this year, different sectors have done well and different markets globally have done well. Sure, if an investor owns just the S&P 500, they’re very much driven by the risk and returns of the Magnificent 7, but most investors have a diversified portfolio where they own other things. Some of those other things have done really well, like gold, for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "You also find that since the Fed’s last rate hike in July, long-duration Treasuries have delivered negative performance — for the first time ever. That sounds pretty significant. \n",
      "\n",
      "The typical pattern is that the Fed raises rates, which we saw them do from March of 2022 through to July of 2023, that ultimately slows the economy and cools inflation, and then as a result, the Fed needs to respond by cutting rates and rates fall. For the first time ever, that has not been the pattern — rates have actually climbed, not fallen.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we look at yields, they basically contain three things — growth expectations, inflation expectations and this wonky thing called “term premium.” What’s happened is growth has been much better than markets expected, inflation has been much stickier than investors have expected and then finally, because we’re running such a large deficit, the Treasury has to issue far more debt than they have historically at this time. But the Fed and other traditional purchasers of Treasuries are buying less, so supply is increasing while demand is falling. As a result, rates are higher, not lower. This is the first time that’s happened, ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fed announced last week that it will start to wind down its quantitative tightening program. Does that change anything?\n",
      "\n",
      "You are seeing a little bit of a downward pressure on 10-year Treasury yields today. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that we don’t expect to have rate hikes. So, it’s a matter of rate cuts, but when?\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic data is cooling; the most recent GDP figure shows that the US economy is growing at a slower rate. That should put downward pressure on yields. If the Fed is easier on monetary policy, that should help. The thing that continues to be a bit of an outlier is sticky inflation. But ultimately, if the economy continues to slow, yields should in fact, fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the thing is, that inflation part is tricky. There’s a number of things that I think make the last mile of inflation difficult. There’s supply-demand imbalances, and things like housing market, the labor market; we’re trying to make this multi-decade transition from fossil fuels to something else, that’s proven more inflationary than people anticipated. You have geopolitical conflict, which has pushed up the price of oil. And given the deficits, the Treasury will have to continue to issue more bonds. So, I think that those components may keep rates higher than the markets expect. That doesn’t mean that rates will keep rising, it just means that the markets expect them to fall dramatically. I’m not so sure.\n",

      "US investors have a lot to sweat this year: still-too-high inflation, a lack of clarity about when rates will come down to earth, tense foreign relations, and now, a presidential election season that is officially in full swing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Welcome to “Super Tuesday.” Today, a whopping 16 states and territories hold primary elections. And, as campaigning heats up, so too do investors’ worries: About one-third of Americans believe their investment strategy could change depending on who the next president is, according to recent research from Edward Jones.\n",
      "\n",
      "But stock market analysts say not to fret and to hold tight. They think markets are ultimately more powerful than politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Markets over politics: This election cycle, polling and early primaries make Donald Trump and President Joe Biden the frontrunners in the 2024 race. Markets like certainty, and because both candidates have already been president, there’s some relief about the familiarity and knowledge of what to expect, said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although there are large divergences between the major candidates’ views on the economy, politics and policies often influence the market less than other factors. For example, Covid decimated a tax-break-induced market run during Trump’s administration. Markets loved Biden’s stimulus plan in his first year, but the Federal Reserve’s hyper-aggressive rate hikes in response to inflation sent stocks tumbling in 2022, only to rebound in 2023 and this year in anticipation of rate cuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, promises made by candidates are not always promises kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What sounds promising during election campaigns often may not work in reality, so don’t put stock (literally or figuratively) into those claims,” Kourkafas said. “Market forces are more influential than political forces over the long term.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The stock market has increased under every political combination in Washington, and the economy has grown regardless of which party controlled the White House and Congress, Edward Jones found.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s part of what analysts at Raymond James call the perception gap, where political polarization can distort economic views.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example: “The annualized return for the S&P [500] was almost identical in the Trump administration and the Obama administration, despite antithetical policies and beliefs,” said Simon Hamilton, a financial adviser at Raymond James.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on annualized returns for the S&P 500, stocks gained an average 13.75% during Trump’s presidency. President Barack Obama saw a 13.84% return over both of his terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Political talk can also paint a bleaker economic picture than the data suggests: More than 48% of Americans say they believe the economy remains in a downturn, according to a recent CNN poll. But, in reality, incomes are up, the economy is growing and consumer sentiment is near recent highs. While 49% of Democrats said they believe the economy is recovering, just 6% of Republicans said the same thing, according to the poll.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because there’s so much political discord and polarization, even though a Republican may still be spending plenty, their perception of the economy is negative,” said Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors are reminded every four years that “markets are, at the end of the day, guided by the broader path of the economy, earnings and interest rates, not politics,” said Kourkafas. “That’s not to downplay the importance of the democratic process. But we have a long history of market data that support this view.”\n",
      "\n",
      "How to ride the wave: There may be some knee-jerk market reactions to political developments, especially as we get closer to November, said Kourkafas, but it’s “crucial to tune out the noise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The success and resiliency of the markets don’t change with each election, “and neither should your investment strategy,” he said.\n",
      "\n",

A recent survey of 2,000 American women with pelvic floor issues revealed that many have unanswered health questions, with younger generations having even more—Gen Z averaging 11, compared to baby boomers' five. Age 40 is identified as the point when women become more serious about their health concerns. Common pelvic health issues include chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis, fibroids, and pelvic congestion syndrome. These conditions can lead to significant physical, emotional, and mental health impacts, affecting social and romantic lives, as well as work availability. Financial burdens are also notable, with an average monthly expenditure of $334.50 on treatments and related health management. Recognizing symptoms such as involuntary urine leaks, a bulging sensation in the vagina, or difficulty emptying the bladder or bowels is essential. Early intervention through exercises like Kegels and breathing techniques can help avoid the need for surgery. Nutrition plays a key role in pelvic floor health; a balanced diet rich in fiber can ease symptoms and support long-term recovery. Reducing bladder irritants and staying hydrated are important for maintaining a healthy pelvic floor. Taking proactive steps, such as consulting with a specialist and adjusting dietary habits, can significantly improve quality of life and pelvic health. Women are encouraged to advocate for their own health, seek specialized care if needed, and ensure persistent pain is properly addressed by medical professionals.​\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Democratic Party’s favorability rating among Americans stands at a record low, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, fueled in part by dimming views from its own frustrated supporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "With many in the party saying publicly that their leaders should do more to stand up to President Donald Trump, Democrats and Democratic-aligned independents say, 57% to 42%, that Democrats should mainly work to stop the Republican agenda, rather than working with the GOP majority to get some Democratic ideas into legislation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The survey was taken March 6-9, days before 10 Democratic senators — including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — voted with Republicans in the chamber to advance a GOP-authored spending bill to avert a government shutdown, much to the chagrin of many other Democratic lawmakers and progressive critics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The majority’s desire to fight the GOP marks a significant change in the party’s posture from the start of Trump’s first term. A September 2017 poll found a broad 74% majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners saying their party should work with Republicans in an attempt to advance their own priorities, and just 23% advocating for a more combative approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Democratic-aligned adults say, 52% to 48%, that the leadership of the Democratic Party is currently taking the party in the wrong direction. That’s another shift from eight years ago, when views on this metric were largely positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the American public overall, the Democratic Party’s favorability rating stands at just 29% – a record low in CNN’s polling dating back to 1992 and a drop of 20 points since January 2021, when Trump exited his first term under the shadow of the January 6 attack at on Capitol. The Republican Party’s rating currently stands at 36%.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s driven in part by relatively high levels of dissatisfaction within the Democratic Party. Just 63% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents report a favorable view of their own party, a dip from 72% in January and 81% at the start of President Joe Biden’s administration. The decline comes across ideological wings, with favorability ratings for the Democratic Party falling by 18 points among liberals and moderates alike since the start of 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "By contrast, 79% of Republicans and Republican leaners currently take a positive view of the GOP. Political independents as a group take dim views of both parties, with 19% rating the Democrats favorably and 20% saying the same of the Republicans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the Democratic and the Republican parties are viewed by about half the public as having views and policies that are too extreme, rather than generally mainstream. That’s a change from 2022, when most Americans – 56% – called the Democratic Party’s positions mainstream. Views of the GOP have remained effectively unchanged over that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Political independents remain likelier to see the Republicans as out of the mainstream – 57% call the GOP too extreme, while 48% say the same of the Democrats. But 16% of Democrats call their own party too extreme, while just 9% of Republicans say the same of the GOP.\n",
      "\n",
      "The public continues to draw a distinction between Trump and his party. Americans are 9 points likelier to call the president too extreme than to say the same of the Republican Party as a whole, although that’s down from an 18-point gap in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats, who overwhelmingly consider Trump too extreme, have yet to consolidate around any one-party leader to serve as a counterpoint. Asked in an open-ended question to name the Democratic leader they feel “best reflects the core values” of the party, 10% of Democratic-aligned adults name New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 9% former vice president Kamala Harris, 8% Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and 6% House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Another 4% each name former president Barack Obama and Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, with Schumer joining a handful of others at 2%.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 30% didn’t offer a name in response. “No one,” one respondent answered. “That’s the problem.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who delivered the party’s response to Trump’s presidential address this month, remains largely unknown. A separate question finds that nearly three-quarters of Americans have never heard of her or have no opinion of her, with the remainder roughly split in their opinions. Slotkin is scarcely better known within her own party, although Democratic-aligned adults who do express a view of her are largely positive, 24% favorable to 6% unfavorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ocasio Cortez’s stock in the party is especially high among those who describe themselves as liberal and those younger than 45, with roughly 1 in 6 within each of those groups calling her emblematic of the party’s values. No Democratic leader polled in the double digits among older adults or moderates on this metric.\n",
      "\n",
      "Democratic-aligned adults’ views of their party and its leadership also divide sharply along demographic lines, the poll finds. Those who call themselves Democrats are far likelier than independents who lean toward the party to express favorable views of the Democrats (72% to 37%), and to say the party’s leaders are taking it in the right direction (53% to 34%).\n",
      "\n",

      "Amid Democrats’ shock and bickering over how much to respond to President Donald Trump is a deeper question rippling through leaders across the Capitol and across the country: How much should they rely on the same institutional and procedural maneuvers they used during the first Trump term, and how much are they willing to wield their own wrecking balls?\n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats remain essentially leaderless, with prospective future presidential candidates largely sitting back and allowing others to be the first ones through the buzzsaw of Trump and his cheerleaders, none eager to be the face of a party just yet. They are disconnected from the Democratic National Committee, where the Obama-era rallying cry of “Yes We Can!” became the watered down facsimile slogan “Yes We Ken!” for Ken Martin, the largely unknown insider who emerged as the winner of the recent chair race that the party’s most prominent figures avoided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those Democrats left trying to take charge doubt the slower court challenges can keep up with the rapid, precision onslaught mounting each day from presidential appointees and associates of Elon Musk. For whatever judgments do come out in their favor, many believe – though few will yet say so publicly – that Trump may soon just start ignoring what he doesn’t like, and they’ll have no recourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump dismissed this on Tuesday, telling reporters in the Oval Office, “I always abide by the courts,” just days after Vice President JD Vance had tweeted, “Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power” — and days before Trump posted on Saturday, “He who saves his country does not violate any law,” a line nearly matching one that appeared in a 1970 movie about Napoleon.\n",
      "\n",
      "What hopes Democrats have to counter Trump rest for now on the mid-March government budget deadline, the first real inflection point for a party that is not just in the minority in the House and Senate, but facing a Republican majority so in thrall to the president that they cheer him on as he rapidly absorbs powers from Congress, while they’re left holding contrived attempts to visit buildings that Trump and Musk have locked shut while they dismantle operations inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not going to stand by and support an effort to dismantle our democracy through the budgeting process,” said Rep. Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat, as he left a rally outside the offices of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protest its overnight shuttering by the White House, where he and two dozen colleagues pledged not to vote for any bill until, as the co-founder of the group Indivisible put it, “this Constitutional crisis is over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Johnson argued that the whole mentality is different from the December shutdown threat, when Democrats also complained but ultimately provided enough votes to make up for Republican defections even though they got limited concessions. “We’ve got to do everything we can, every tool in the toolbox to oppose what is actually happening right before our eyes,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "That kind of emergency protocol is crashing into Democrats in the House and Senate who remain confident history will repeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I remember eight years ago when skeptical reporters were seeing protests and said, ‘Oh come on, it’s almost two years until the midterms, will people really stay engaged and energized? The answer proved to be yes. And in fact, the numbers even grew,” said Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle, as he headed on Thursday to a long hearing over the budget that Democrats hope lets them win back some ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others argue they have to be the ones to hold the institutions in place, keeping their resistance within bounds of forcing debates through the night on votes they are going to lose and rallies in front of buildings that Trump has locked them out of, where they say things like “a rally a day keeps the fascists away,” as Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin did at the CFPB rally, and then head home again with their signs.\n",

      "“Clearly this is a man that is driving an agenda that’s breaking the law, violating civil service laws, violating common sense, violating fiscal prudence, benefiting corrupt practices,” said New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, when asked by CNN if he thought Democrats were doing as much as he wants to push back on the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You pull every lever that you have on things that you disagree on, but I have to say, this idea that to shut the whole place down…” Booker said, his voice trailing off, and then affirming he does not support any kind of government shutdown. “The levers that we have are limited, but at the same time, all of us share the lever of speaking out, of raising popular sentiment.”\n",

      "Existential tug-of-war between going too far and not far enough\n",
      "For top Democrats in and out of elected office, every day is an existential tug-of-war between worrying about sounding like shrill paranoiacs and worrying that they are not saying or doing nearly enough. They don’t know what the next three-and-a-half years are supposed to be when they already hit “Constitutional crisis” in the first three-and-a-half weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The reason people feel angry about what’s happening is not because we’re not doing everything in our power,” argued Rep. Sean Casten, a Democrat from Illinois. “It’s because they’re wondering, when in God’s name did it become partisan to defend the Constitution? Why is it partisan to say that it’s bad to give Nazi salutes? Why is it partisan to say the Reconstruction amendments that provide equal protection for all are not worth defending anymore?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Casten, like several of his House Democratic colleagues who spoke to CNN, said he has been surprised and heartened by how many constituents have been calling into tele-town halls, and by the responses he has been hearing: “In three weeks, the public mood has gone from apathy to fear to anger. And I think the next thing in that cycle is action.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Casten said that activist leaders have told him and colleagues that they fear protests against Trump might eventually be used as a predicate for declaring martial law. Other House Democrats echoed this privately, and several left-leaning activist group leaders told CNN directly that their own safety concerns for participants have risen since the president’s blanket pardons for January 6 rioters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It only took 50 days for Hitler to destroy democracy in Germany,” Casten said, arguing that there are direct parallels to those moves and much of what Trump is doing. “Part of our job right now as Democrats in Washington inside of this is to be Churchillian, very clear-eyed about what the stakes of this moment are, what the parallels in history are, remind people that the majority of Americans are good people, and that the way you shut a bully down is to punch back.”\n",

      "“My impression is that nothing is more miserable right now than being a Republican member of Congress. They’re at Mar-a-Lago over at the White House when he’s signing the executive orders. Are they being brought in at all to his plan? They’re not at all,” said Rep. Haley Stevens, a Michigan congresswoman. “They’re neutering their own leadership.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Casten said as he walks around on the floor and hears Republican colleagues quietly telling him they agree with some of what he’s saying about Trump. He now sees people he suspects are so convinced that they’re in end times to feel they “are never going to have to worry about another democratic election,” or at least wouldn’t object if the situation came to that.\n",

      "“How are you feeling?” he recalled a colleague asked him while they were sitting in the House chamber the other day.\n",

      "Kicking off a Congressional Progressive Caucus meeting this week, new chair Texas Rep. Greg Casar read from Franklin Roosevelt’s 1936 speech to the Democratic convention, where he spoke about “clouds of suspicion, tides of ill-will and intolerance gather darkly in many places,” and said “privileged princes of these new economic dynasties, thirsting for power, reached out for control over government itself.”\n",

      "“We should be talking about the fact that it is not immigrants that are raising your rent, it is hedge funds that are buying up your neighborhoods and raising your rent. It is not LGBT Americans that are screwing up, you have, your health care, it’s corporate CEOs who are,” Casar said. “If we don’t want to continue in this cycle where we win, then we lose, we win, then we lose, but we keep trending downward, we have to fundamentally transform what the Democratic Party has become in the last 25 years.”\n",

      "In polls and focus groups across an array of internal Democratic groups and allies, described to CNN, centering on talking about prices remains the most prevalent advice — and it’s where House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries has kept returning to, flanked by signs at his two most recent weekly press conferences headlined “HOW IS THIS LOWERING COSTS?” and “REPUBLICANS BETRAY THE MIDDLE CLASS.”\n",

      "Jeffries, who likes baseball as much as he likes historical statistics, sees an example of Yankees slugger Aaron Judge, who has one of the highest whiff rates in baseball, but also led the league in both walks and home runs. This is a lesson, he says, in not swinging at everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are wrangling behind the scenes about who can keep their own members in line and for what.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with Schumer 20 years older, further in the minority now and much less likely to have a realistic shot at getting back to the majority in the 2026 midterms, Democrats’ political attention against Trump is zeroing in on the House.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeffries and his team believe they will have more pressure to exert as the budget talks near, with swing district Republicans in their tiny majority already signaling that they will oppose cuts the leadership is putting forward, in addition to the expected House Freedom Caucus defections.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they are also carefully watching how public mood is shifting on the ground in the most closely divided districts, not yet convinced that voters want the kind of resistance to Trump that they or the loudest activists are demanding\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly before he left the Capitol to spend a week back in his own district and listening to what his members will be hearing in their own, Jeffries paused for a moment when asked what he would say to Democrats who have given up hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep hope alive. The Trump administration is losing in court, not winning. Over and over and over again,” he said. “And they have not achieved a single legislative victory. And his approval ratings aren’t going up—they’re going down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The challenge for Jeffries and his fellow Democrats as they search for a way forward is the new political reality: Trump has already notched one court win on his plans to reduce the federal workforce, he signed into law a GOP-led bill to require the detention of undocumented migrants charged with certain crimes that drew Democratic support and his poll numbers are as high as they have been in his 10 years in politics.\n",

      "Suddenly, the party’s attempt to usher in a new era of receptiveness with the White House is turning out to be more complicated in practice. Just days into his second term, Trump is once again baiting his political opponents and scrambling their playbook in real time.\n",

      "“We’ve gone back to our playbook which is, ‘attack him,’ instead of actually dealing with the fact that the party doesn’t have a message, doesn’t really have a spokesperson,” one senior House Democrat said of the strategy. “We’re just going back to the shrill attacks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As that messaging debate continues, Democrats are also grappling with how to play in a social media landscape they feel like they’ve fallen behind on.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a private Senate Democratic luncheon last week, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey led colleagues through the shifting dynamics of a media echo chamber that conservatives are thriving in. Democrats scoured examples of how conspiracy theories like one about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, spread rapidly in the conservative media sphere and how Democrats needed to try to harness their own tools to get their messages out better.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the bright spots Democrats highlighted, according to a source familiar, was a viral video from the pandemic of Warner making a tuna melt in his kitchen that led to the lawmaker being cheered and jeered by people who questioned his culinary leanings.\n",

      "“The communications ecosystem has changed profoundly in ways that most people in their 60s and 70s don’t grasp,” one Democratic senator said of the message of the presentation.\n",

      "Senators talked about the need to repost each other’s social media posts to try and organically get their message out. But they also argued they can’t abandon traditional media altogether.\n",

      "The special legislative elections – held one day after Congress certified Trump’s 2024 presidential win – served as an early test of voter enthusiasm for both parties as the former president returns for a second term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the liberal lean of the districts – the previous incumbents won both seats by about 61% of the vote in 2023 – Democrats said they weren’t taking the seats for granted given Trump’s growing support there and the unpredictable nature of special elections. Most of early voting for the seats occurred during the holiday season, and a Monday winter storm dumped several inches of snow on Loudoun County and kept schools closed. Both Democratic candidates drastically outspent their Republican opponents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The incoming president won 10,000 more votes in the county in 2024 than he did in 2020, while Vice President Kamala Harris received 9,092 fewer votes than President Joe Biden did in 2020. While Biden won the county by 25 percentage points, Harris won by 16.2 points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Republicans ran on issues that Trump touted, including no tax on tips and border security. As in-person early voting drew to a close, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and other GOP leaders rallied with Harding and Venkatachalam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Democratic candidates argued they needed to keep control of the state legislature to serve as a check on Trump’s power.

      "“As we face increasing extremism at the federal level, it’s more important than ever for Democrats to fight back in the states, build local power, and win elections up and down the ballot,” Roger Lau, the deputy executive director of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the aftermath of the 2024 elections, Democrats are less optimistic about their party’s future than they’ve been at any point in the past eight years, according to new Pew Research Center polling released Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poll, which was conducted November 12-17, also finds that views of President-elect Donald Trump continue a pattern seen pre-election: Americans largely express confidence in his plans for the economy, while continuing to rate him negatively on many personal characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roughly half (51%) of Democrats and independents who lean toward the party say they’re optimistic, while 49% say that they’re pessimistic about its future. Democratic pessimism is up compared with both 2016, when 38% said they were feeling that way in the wake of Trump’s first presidential victory, and in 2020, when 17% of Democratic-aligned adults described themselves as pessimistic after Joe Biden’s win in 2020. They also didn’t feel this pessimistic in the wake of the 2018 and 2022 midterms.\n",
      "\n",
      "By contrast, 86% of Republican-aligned adults now call themselves optimistic about the GOP’s future, up from 65% who said the same two years ago. Roughly 8 in 10 said they were optimistic following Trump’s 2016 election and the 2018 midterms, with 74% calling themselves optimistic after Biden’s 2020 victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Democratic pessimism this year is particularly pronounced among younger members of the party, with 55% of Democratic-aligned adults younger than 50 taking a negative view of the party’s future, compared with 39% among their older counterparts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, half of US adults say that the Republican Party represents their interests at least somewhat well, modestly higher than the 43% who currently say the same of the Democratic Party. While the Democratic Party’s standing on this metric is largely unchanged from July 2023, the GOP number is up 11 percentage points over that time. That shift, Pew finds, is due almost wholly to Republican-aligned adults’ increasingly positive assessments of their party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just over half, 53%, say they approve of Trump’s “policies and plans for the future,” with the same share giving him positive ratings for his conduct since winning the election. A 59% majority say they’re at least somewhat confident in him to make good decisions about economic policy, with majorities also expressing confidence in him to effectively handle law enforcement and criminal justice issues (54%), make wise decisions about immigration policy (53%) and make good decisions about foreign policy (53%). Fewer express confidence in Trump to make good decisions on abortion policy (45%) or to bring the country closer together (41%). And less than half of the public thinks Trump is well described as someone who cares about the needs of ordinary people (45%), or somehow who’s honest (42%), even-tempered (37%) or a good role model (34%).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, half of Americans express positive feelings about Trump’s election victory, with 22% saying they’re excited and 28% saying that they’re relieved, while the rest say they’re disappointed (33%) or angry (15%). In a separate question, about one-third express surprise about his win.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked to rate their feelings about Trump on a scale from 0 to 100, 43% of Americans give him a “warm” rating of 51 or higher, an uptick from 36% following the 2016 election and 34% after his election loss in 2020. A 78% majority of Republican-aligned adults rate him warmly today, compared with 9% among Democratic-aligned adults.\n",

      "By Arit John, CNN\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ken Martin, the head of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, was decisively elected chair of the Democratic National Committee on Saturday, beating a crowded field in the first round of voting to become the new face of a party struggling to find its footing during the second Trump administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin, who has spent 14 years leading the Minnesota party and eight years as a DNC vice chair, emerged as an early front-runner in the race due to his long-standing ties to state party leaders, a key voting bloc. Throughout the campaign, he highlighted his track record: The Minnesota DFL hasn’t lost a single statewide race since he took over the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Martin is tasked with a new challenge: strengthening and transforming the national party to withstand the second Trump administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re going to get to work,” Martin said Saturday in his acceptance speech. “We’re going to go out there and take this fight to Donald Trump.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The election of new party leaders comes as Democrats have grappled with the most effective way to challenge the torrent of action spurred by the Trump White House, which just this week included the president blaming diversity initiatives for a deadly DC plane collision, a federal funding freeze that was rescinded in less than 48 hours amid widespread backlash, and confirmation hearings for three controversial Cabinet nominees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin easily defeated two other leading contenders: Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley.\n",
      "\n",
      "All three candidates claimed to have levels of support that, if combined, would have far exceeded 450 – the total number of voting DNC members. Heading into Saturday, Wikler claimed to have 183 endorsements and O’Malley claimed to have 137, though most of those names were private. Martin had released the names of 200 supporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final vote showed that only one of the candidates was able to back their numbers up: Martin won with 246.5 votes out of 428 cast. Wikler received 134 votes and O’Malley received 44.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results also showed the limited influence of high-profile endorsements. Wikler gained significant outside support in the final days of the campaign, thanks to endorsements from prominent governors, key labor leaders and top congressional leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is not personal, we’re all on the same team. … I have long-standing relationships in the party, and at the end of the day, I’m really buoyed by that enthusiastic support,” Martin told reporters after the vote. “It was a one-ballot victory for a reason, right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to electing Martin, DNC members elected seven additional officers: Gun control activist David Hogg, Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta and Nevada DNC member Artie Blanco were elected to three at-large vice chair positions; Virginia McGregor was reelected treasurer; Jason Rae was reelected secretary; Chris Korge was reelected national finance chair; and Reyna Walters-Morgan will be the next vice chair for civic engagement and voter participation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A new path forward\n",
      "Without a Democratic president in the White House, leadership of the party will be fractured over the next four years. And with Democrats in the minority in both the House and Senate, much of the focus on Capitol Hill will be aimed at blocking Trump’s agenda rather than advancing the party’s policy priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin will be tasked with helping guide the party forward as it looks to rebound from stinging losses last November. Asked what his message is to Trump, Martin said: The gloves are coming off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve always viewed my roles as a chair of the Democratic Party to take the low road so my candidates and elected officials can take the high road,” Martin said. “So Donald Trump, Republican Party: This is a new DNC. We are not going to sit back and not take you on when you fail the American people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to fundraising and messaging, Martin will also help steer the 2028 nominating process and create a campaign-in-waiting for the eventual Democratic nominee.\n",
      "\n",
      "He will also need to unite the committee and address several internal issues, including anger over a wave of layoffs last year, demands for increased transparency around budgets and spending, and frustration with campaign consultants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outgoing chair Jaime Harrison touched on some of those tensions at the top of the elections, when he condemned reports that some DNC members had been intimidated, pressured or threatened by donors who said they would withhold funding over their votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In this party, there will be no tolerance for that type of behavior,” Harrison said. “We must be united because too much is at stake right now in this country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "State party leaders, particularly in non-battleground states, had pushed chair candidates to vow to invest more in their states, and rank-and-file members had called for a more democratized process to access exclusive committees made up of appointees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have never attended a DNC meeting where I left and said, ‘Huh, I learned something,’” Stephanie Campanha Wheaton, one of the Young Democrats of America’s DNC members and a Martin supporter, told CNN. “You show up and you are a pawn, and you nod your head yes to everything that has already been decided upon in committees that you don’t know how people got on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At the heart of the leadership elections is a desire to make sense of the party’s 2024 losses and chart a path out of political obscurity. In more than a dozen forums, questions have focused on how to win back young men and working-class voters, how to fight disinformation, and how to make better use of the millions for dollars flowing into the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a sign of a healthy party to actually question each other, debate each other, think about the path forward,” said Tory Gavito, a Wikler backer and the president of Way to Win, a women-led donor coalition that co-hosted a DNC forum with the Texas Democratic Party. “And in this debating, the goal is to win.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin entered the race first and was an early front-runner thanks to his yearslong relationships with the leaders of various state parties and other DNC members\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Salas, a California DNC member who backed Martin, said he believed the Minnesota chair understands the important role of local committees. On a personal level, he said Martin was the only high-ranking DNC leader to send him a congratulatory card welcoming him to the DNC when he was elected last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It goes to his point about organizing year-round: You can’t come to somebody a couple of months before an election and ask them to do something,” Salas said. “You have to make deposits before you make withdrawals.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wikler experienced a late surge in support fueled by key endorsements from a group of Democratic governors – including DNC voting members Laura Kelly of Kansas, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico – and four large public-sector unions, which issued a joint statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the DNC voters who endorsed Wikler pointed to his track record in Wisconsin since becoming chair in 2019, including winning a liberal majority on the state Supreme Court that paved the way for more competitive legislative maps.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to AFT, Wikler was backed by the leaders of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; National Education Association; and Service Employees International Union. Other unions split their support among the leading candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We felt like Ben Wikler was the one who could build worker power and expand the party’s base,” said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, of the joint union endorsement.\n",
      "\n",
      "O’Malley, meanwhile, picked up public support from a handful of DNC members and high-profile Democrats such as Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. His critiques of Martin and Wikler became more pointed in the final days of the race.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former governor ribbed Wikler for declining to preemptively release a list of donors to his chair campaign ahead of a Friday night FEC deadline and suggested Martin’s support is not as strong as it seems during a gaggle with reporters after a candidate forum Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When the totally inevitable front-runner, who’s been working at it for five years, shows himself not to be totally inevitable, I think it opens up for a larger debate,” O’Malley said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the days leading up to the election, the three front-runners released dozens of endorsements from key Democrats, only some of whom are able to vote in the election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after Martin announced he’d been backed by South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, whose endorsement helped former President Joe Biden win the 2020 Democratic primary, Wikler announced he had the support of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n",
      "\n",
      "One key Democrat did not weigh in on who should be chair: former Vice President Kamala Harris. Though the party has spent weeks debating what went wrong during her 2024 presidential campaign, Harris did not endorse a candidate in the race.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harris spoke on the phone this week with the three leading candidates in the race, a person familiar with the discussions told CNN. In the calls, which each lasted about 15 to 20 minutes, the candidates discussed their visions for the party and expressed their gratitude to Harris for her candidacy and commitment to stay involved with the party’s efforts going forward. The former vice president pledged to work closely with the winning candidate as soon as they’re elected, the source said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In state after state, district after district, from house to house and door to door, you work to energize, organize and mobilize,” Harris said in a video address to the committee after the first round of votes. “And as we continue to fight for our ideals and to realize the promise of America, I will be with you every step of the way.”\n",

      "Democrats have been powerless as they’ve watched President Donald Trump systematically move to dismantle federal agencies and push the bounds of his office with little concern about the fallout.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they do have one looming piece of leverage: the March 14 deadline to avert a government shutdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "House and Senate Democrats at the highest levels are now engaged in a fierce debate about what exactly to demand in their first big negotiation with Trump and how forcefully to push, according to conversations with more than two dozen members and senior aides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump and GOP leaders will need Democratic support in the Senate, where 60 votes would be required to advance the bill. In the House, they have to contend with a contingent of conservatives unlikely to vote for any spending bill. While rank-and-file Democrats are eager to play hardball with Trump, other senior Democrats are uncertain how firm of a line to draw, fearing they may be forced to capitulate in a funding feud and ultimately appear even weaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his Senate counterpart, Chuck Schumer, have been in talks about how best to use the funding deadline to counter Trump. But some top Democrats worry that even if they won policy concessions, Trump would only ignore the law — as they believe he has in some of his initial assaults on federal agencies — so a knockdown, drag-out battle and potential shutdown could be all for naught.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the foundational role of Congress is the power of the purse, why would we ever believe them again on an appropriations deal?” said Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware. “It’s going to be harder for us to work together because it’s harder for us to trust each other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And as one senior aide described the situation: “There’s just not a lot of good options for Democrats.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Many exasperated Democrats, even some from battleground House districts, insist a shutdown shouldn’t be off the table if Republicans can’t put up the votes themselves. But Schumer and other governing-minded senators are proceeding more cautiously, wary of provoking a damaging shutdown and getting a share of the blame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, even as Jeffries and Schumer have intensified their attacks on Elon Musk’s role in Trump’s government, it’s uncertain whether they’ll take aim at the tech billionaire when it comes time to negotiate a funding deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview last week, Jeffries indicated Democrats’ legislative push to block Musk’s access to government payment systems is not “at the moment” one of their demands in the funding fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are bipartisan negotiations that are underway right now to try to reach a spending agreement that meets the needs of the American people,” Jeffries told CNN. “I’ve encouraged those bipartisan conversations to continue.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But other Democrats say there must be a steep price for any Democratic votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re not going to keep on bailing him out,” added Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, who is among a growing faction of Democrats who are ready to stare down Trump in a shutdown fight. “We’re not a cheap date.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the Capitol, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, stressed that the party needed to “use every point of leverage that we have” and that democracy itself is at stake. But he also acknowledged the risks of fighting too hard and landing in a shutdown: “Nobody wants a shutdown, but we have leverage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, another veteran of congressional spending battles who represents a huge share of federal workers in Virginia, said the party needed to fight to “protect the rule of law” and halt Trump’s dismantling of government. “But who knows,” he added grimly, “that may be all destroyed by the time [the deadline] comes about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s slashing of Washington programs — particularly for the US Agency for International Development — has put Democrats in a quandary. While the party universally supports the mission of the agency and believes Musk’s efforts to gut it flout federal law, some are uneasy about making foreign aid a centerpiece of a government shutdown fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As tragic as it is what’s happened to USAID and our efforts abroad, I’m not sure that it hits many Americans emotionally — certainly not outside the Beltway,” said Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why a shutdown could still happen\n",
      "Avoiding a shutdown will be difficult. Just over a month before the deadline, top House and Senate appropriators remain divided on reaching a basic agreement about how much Congress should spend in a fiscal year that’s already halfway over.\n",
      "\n",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday accused Democrats of “trying to set up some sort of government shutdown” and said their negotiators have retreated from talks in recent days.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Democrats dispute his characterization. They say the bigger problem is that Republicans in the House and Senate are at odds among themselves over the spending levels.\n",

      "“We want to make sure that once we come to an agreement, it can’t just be thrown out the window after it’s passed into law by a lawless Trump-Elon administration that is currently running things,” said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Don’t swing at every pitch’\n",
      "Jeffries and his team are keeping close tabs on their most vulnerable members, many of whom represent Trump-won districts.

      "“I don’t think people like when their government shuts down, and I don’t think the average person watches the debate so closely that they know whose fault it is,” said Sen. Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat who won a critical battleground seat where Trump also won.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Democrats try to apply lessons from their 2024 losses, they’ve differed on how hard — and how often — to push back against Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rep. Al Green of Texas, for instance, went to the floor Wednesday to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump. Two other House Democrats filmed themselves forcing their way into Johnson’s office to discuss Musk’s access to Treasury Department payment systems. A day later, Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman protested the GOP’s holding of the National Prayer Breakfast in the Capitol, which he called symbolic of the MAGA “dystopian authoritarian agenda.”\n",
      "\n",

I do not believe in this theory that we should sit in the bushes and wait for some moment down the line when things get really, really bad. They’re bad right now,” said Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut. “We’re going to need everybody to be even louder in the coming days.”\n",

      "By Arit John, CNN\n",
      "\n",
      "As Democrats head toward an uncertain future under a second Trump administration, the party’s search for a new leader to help rebuild the party also remains unsettled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process of choosing a new Democratic National Committee chair kicked off Saturday, when eight candidates met virtually in the first party-run forum of the race. With three weeks to go before the February 1 election, no candidate has locked up support from a majority of the 448 party insiders who’ll choose the next party leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chair race marks the first major decision Democrats will make after facing disastrous losses in last year’s general election. The contest to lead the party, and the various unofficial forums and small group meetings that preceded Saturday’s event, have become a space for Democrats to hash out what went wrong, how to reach the voters who abandoned the party in November and how the millions of dollars spent in lost swing states might have been better used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite early reports that some high-profile names were considering joining the race, the current field of eight candidates – led by Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party chair Ken Martin, Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley – is made up of figures who are not well known nationally.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many DNC members, that’s a bonus.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The vibe I get is that people are super hungry for an operative chair,” said one DNC member who is part of a state delegation. “We want workhorses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The DNC is made up of a mix of state party leaders and committee people, members of allied Democratic groups, union leaders and at-large members appointed by the current chair. The largest bloc consists of the state party leaders, who have made investments in their states a key issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solidifying support from state party chairs and vice chairs, who make up about 114 members of the DNC and have influence over their state delegations, could prove key to winning a race where no candidate has locked up a majority of support.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DNC will hold three additional forums: one in Detroit on January 16 focused on the Midwest; one virtually on January 23 focused on the West; and a final in-person event in Washington, DC, on January 30, focused on the East.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturday’s forum focused on the issues of the South.\n",
      "\n",
      "Christale Spain, the chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party who is still deciding who she’ll back in the February 1 election, said she wanted to know the candidates’ plans for funding a “Southern strategy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We just cannot concede ground because it’s hard,” Spain said ahead of the forum. “We can win in the South, but it’s just going to take a long-term investment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "During the debate, the candidates discussed their plans to invest in Southern states through recruitment, messaging and more funding for state parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I say we have to focus on a 10-year strategy which rejects Southern political disinvestment, it’s not a platitude — it’s mission-critical,” Martin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many DNC members are hoping now is the time to shake up not just how funds are distributed but how the party operates broadly. The last time Democrats were able to elect a DNC chair – in 2017, after Donald Trump first won the White House – the party instituted major reforms to address the concerns of progressives who backed independent Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time around, candidates are being pressed on messaging to working class voters, holding consultants accountable and investing in state parties frustrated by the disparity between the amount of money that went into battleground states and what could have been spent to make their races more competitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s difficult to say how much support any candidate has. The DNC doesn’t publicly release its member lists, and no campaigns have released full lists of their endorsements.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the campaigns of the leading candidates, Martin has “well over 100” endorsements; O’Malley has “60+ and counting”; New York state Sen. James Skoufis has 23 endorsements; and Wikler has declined to release numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to Martin, Wikler, O’Malley and Skoufis, four other candidates have gathered enough signatures to appear at the Saturday forum: former congressional candidate Quintessa Hathaway; attorney and political strategist Jason Paul; Nate Snyder, a former US Department of Homeland Security official; and former presidential candidate Marianne Williamson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deep ties\n",
      "Martin – who has been a state party chair since 2011 and now chairs the Association of State Democratic Committees – has the deepest ties to state party leaders. In interviews, chairs who’ve endorsed him said he’s been a constant presence over the years, providing insight, aiding with fundraising and traveling through their states with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this month, Martin campaigned in northern Virginia on behalf of candidates running in special elections for an open state House and Senate seat. Susan Swecker, the chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said he also visited Virginia in the fall to campaign for congressional candidates and in 2021 when Democrats lost the governorship.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One of the things I love about Ken is he shows up and is ready to do the hard work,” Swecker said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russ Carnahan, a former US representative who now leads the Missouri Democratic Party, said Martin had been instrumental in helping the party rebuild when Carnahan took over in 2023. As the race unfolded, Carnahan suggested to his state’s delegation that they vote as a bloc.\n",
      "\n",
      "“About three minutes into the meeting, everybody was like, ‘Well, this is a no brainer: Ken,’” he said. “We know what he’s done in his own state, we know what he’s done nationally, and we know what he’s done very substantially to help us in Missouri.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesperson for Wikler pointed to his work with his colleagues. In 2021, the Wisconsin Democratic Party donated $300,000 to the Florida Democratic Party to help them pay for staff health insurance. Wikler also advised entrepreneur and Democratic donor Reid Hoffman to send funds to the Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina and Ohio state parties, according to the spokesperson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allies of Martin have portrayed Wikler as too closely tied to donors at a time when Democrats are questioning the party’s ties to the consultant class. But the Wisconsin Democrat’s supporters note that whoever leads the party must be able to fundraise – an area where Wikler has excelled. In 2024, his state party raised nearly $62 million, more than any other state party committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lavora Barnes, the outgoing chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, said she was endorsing Wikler because of the work he’d done building up the state party in Wisconsin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s been helpful to me to have Ben to call to bounce ideas off of, to share thoughts, to occasionally commiserate with – and Ben has done the same with me,” she said. “We have been truly able to help each other through some tough moments during these campaigns.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wide open race\n",
      "As the race heads into its final weeks, Barnes argued that DNC members are still weighing their options.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think that everyone who is watching this should consider it an open race, that there are still votes to be gotten, and that Ben is going to do all he can to get each and every one of those votes,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "No candidate has claimed as many private endorsements or released as many public ones as Martin – including endorsements from eight state delegations and the party chairs of seven additional states. But other campaigns say the Minnesotan also failed to secure enough votes to lock up the office and expect that no candidate will win a majority of ballots during the first round of voting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one’s been able to run away with it over the past two months,” Skoufis said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others have pointed to the news that the Association of State Democratic Committees, the group Martin chairs that represents the largest voting bloc in the DNC, decided this week not to endorse a candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those arguing the race is still fluid have also pointed to the news this week that the ASDC, the group of which Wikler is a member, decided not to endorse. While Martin’s supporters said state party leaders felt choosing would not be conducive to party unity, backers of other campaigns said it was a sign there are votes to be won among the ASDC’s ranks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That says that they are still open, and they’re still looking,” former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, an O’Malley supporter who cannot vote in the DNC election, told CNN. “I think that there is an opportunity, clearly, for someone to make their case.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another DNC member, who said they are considering Martin and Wikler while “keeping an open mind” about O’Malley, said their colleagues were “underwhelmed” by the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do think a lot of folks who are keeping their powder dry are still waiting to see if somebody else jumps in,” they said. “If there is somebody else with any sort of stature who is compelling or inspiring it shouldn’t be that hard for them to make the ballot.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Slotkin at age 48 became the youngest Democratic woman elected to the Senate when she won a competitive seat in November after serving in the US House. A former CIA analyst who held national security roles under Presidents George W.

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "By Tierney Sneed and Lauren Fox, CNN\n",
      "\n",
      "The first vote the lame-duck Senate will take as it returns Tuesday will be on a nominee for a Chicago federal court, kicking off Democrats’ uphill campaign to confirm as many of President Joe Biden’s picks for the judiciary as possible before losing power at the end of next month.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time Biden leaves office, he will not be able to fully counter the makeover of the Supreme Court and of federal appeals courts that President-elect Donald Trump achieved during his first term. He could, however, come close to or even eclipse Trump’s numbers on district judges who will be the first line of defense in the legal battles over Trump’s agenda in the next four years.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are 17 judicial nominees who have already been advanced by the Senate Judiciary Committee and are ready for a floor vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s return to the White House will only increase the influence he’s had on the federal bench, so every judge confirmed in the lame-duck session will be one less vacancy that he can fill.\n",
      "\n",
      "But holding the White House and Senate majority for another few weeks doesn’t guarantee Democrats will have an easy time processing the final batch of Biden appointees. Many of the pending nominees have been ready for floor votes for months due to unified GOP opposition. And Trump has called on Republicans to blockade the remaining Biden picks, meaning that the White House could need all of the Democratic votes they can get, including from members who are retiring or were defeated last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is a push across the board from the White House and the Senate for Democrats to show up and do the job they were elected to do,” a senior White House official, asking for anonymity to speak candidly, told CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "A symbol of the Democratic worry is the renewed concerns that Republicans can flip another seat on the 6-3 Supreme Court because Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is 70, did not step down when Biden and Senate Democrats would have been well-poised to replace her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sotomayor has indicated to colleagues that she has no plans to step down this year, and Democrats were not planning on launching a concerted effort to convince her to retire in the lame duck, a maneuver that would have created its own risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there may have been some outside talk of that in the election’s immediate aftermath, Democratic Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called that “fantasy football discussions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Maggie Jo Buchanan, the managing director of Demand Justice, which advocates for progressive judicial nominations, told CNN that the emphasis is on lower court judges, as she called on Democratic Senate leadership to work through the remaining weekends if need be.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are firmly focused on the nominees that we know and pushing the Senate to do whatever is possible to get them off the finish line,” Buchanan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The White House official pointed to how Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn on Saturday promised “no weekends, no breaks” to confirm Trump’s Cabinet once he took power, and the White House official encouraged Democrats to show that dedication to judges in Biden’s final stretch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope we are going to see some later nights,” the official said, suggesting Senate leaders rethink the usual 6 p.m. end time for their workdays. “On a day you would normally process two nominees, why not process three?”\n",
      "\n",
      "A final sprint after 213 judges confirmed\n",
      "The Democratic judicial push has confirmed 213 Biden nominees to the federal bench so far and has broken records in terms of racial and professional diversity, even if Biden is still short of the 234 judges Trump put on the bench in his first term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats are vowing to close out strong. “From what I understand, it’s going to be a robust few weeks,” said New Jersey Sen. George Helmy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to get as many possible nominees confirmed, Senate leaders will need floor time, Republican absences and a willingness from Democrats to stand firm behind nominees that have been targeted with vigorous GOP opposition. Democrats will also have to juggle confirmation effort with the work that will need to be done to pass a spending bill to avert a government shutdown and the annual defense policy bill in December.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Republicans are united against a nominee, the defection of just two Democratic-aligned senators would be the end of the road. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, an independent, has also warned previously he will not advance any nominees that only have one party’s support.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some of the most controversial of Biden’s picks for the federal bench, Democrats have successfully brought the nominees up for floor votes when enough Republicans were absent. Hope remains among liberals that the attendance stars align again in the lame duck so that long-stalled nominees, like 3rd Circuit nominee Adeel Mangi, can finally be confirmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If confirmed, Mangi would be the first Muslim judge on any US federal appeals court.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even nominees that aren’t controversial on the merits could struggle to get Republican support post-election, said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond School of Law professor who closely tracks the nomination process.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some Republicans could be emboldened by their victories in the presidency and pick up of the Senate,” Tobias said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump is counting on that, urging GOP senators not to allow any nominations to be filled with Biden appointees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No Judges should be approved during this period of time,” Trump said in a social media post this weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senate Republicans, meanwhile, confirmed 14 Trump judicial nominees in the lame-duck period after his 2020 electoral defeat but while the GOP controlled the upper chamber.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Regardless of party, the American people expect their leaders to prioritize the rule of law and ensuring the criminal justice system can function effectively in every stated,” said White House spokesperson Andrew Bates. “Delaying the confirmation of strongly qualified, experienced judges takes a real-life toll on constituents and leads to backlogs of criminal cases.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In his first term, Trump inherited more than 100 openings on the federal bench, benefitting from a Senate that was under GOP control during the last two years of President Barack Obama’s term. That won’t be the case when Trump returns to Washington in January. There are 47 current openings – many of them in for district court seats where Republican home state senators and the White House could not reach agreement on a nominee – and Democrats have 17 nominees ready to fill them pending on the floor. There are around nine – depending on what the calendar will allow – other Biden nominees who could still come through committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Senate Democrats are in a strong position regarding judicial confirmations as we approach the lame duck session given that we have a number of nominees on the floor ready for a vote,” said a spokesperson for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin of Illinois.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Urgency now more than ever’\n",
      "All told, Biden has five nominees queued up for the influential federal appeals court spots, where Trump was able to make a major impact, and four of them are ready for floor votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to Mangi, Biden nominees for the First and Sixth Circuits – Julia Lipez and Karla Campbell, respectively – could face a tough road on the floor after every Republican on the Judiciary Committee voted against them there.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the district courts, other nominees also faced party-line opposition in committee, so their approval on the floor will likely depend on attendance and the possibility that Senate Republican moderates like Sens. Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski cross over to help Democrats.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the wake of the election, Democrats may also be more suspect about voting to advance nominees that they have concerns or questions about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even before the election, one of Biden’s nominees, Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn, who has been selected for Manhattan’s federal trial court, attracted the opposition of Georgia Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, blocking her path out of committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "But other Democrats on the committee argue that the reality of a Trump administration could also work to motivate colleagues to move expeditiously to fill the courts.\n",

      "By Edward-Isaac Dovere and Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n",
      "\n",
      "Eric Adams has united Democrats in New York City. From across the boroughs and otherwise warring ideological factions, there is widespread agreement that the mayor has little to no chance of winning the Democratic primary in June — and that he shouldn’t even try.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of them don’t want to wait that long, calling for Adams to resign or be removed from office immediately, as the number of people quitting the United States attorney’s office in New York mounts and faith in the mayor’s ability to operate independently from President Donald Trump has vanished after the Justice Department called for prosecutors to dismiss the corruption case against Adams.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it’s likely about to get worse for the mayor, as the Rev. Al Sharpton, a key powerbroker who said last week the city “clearly crossed the Rubicon,” is set to convene the city’s Black leadership to decide next steps, while former Gov. Andrew Cuomo is seemingly on the verge of launching his long-expected challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in a city where frustration over the massive influx of migrants and quality-of-life issues runs high, contributing to last November’s best showing for a Republican in a presidential election in years, Adams is out on a limb unlike any other mayor in New York’s history.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s an intense swirl: The interim United States attorney claimed in her resignation letter that Adams’ lawyers offered what amounted to a quid pro quo for cooperation in Trump’s immigration agenda, which a lawyer for Adams has denied. Adams himself chuckled along in a morning appearance on the president’s favorite TV channel, Fox News, as Trump border czar Tom Homan dangled a threat of being “up his butt” if the mayor didn’t follow through on his immigration commitments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adams struggled to pivot back to his core message: Immigration enforcement will be focused on dangerous criminals and purported gang members, and the shockwaves were so much that the mayor issued an unusual statement Friday insisting he “never offered — nor did anyone offer on my behalf — any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot see a scenario where this mayor can continue to govern in this city, it’s just untenable,” New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who is first in the line of succession, told CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Williams, who is not a close ally of Adams, said he was being careful with his words, weighing the seriousness and “painful situation” of calling for the removal or resignation of the duly elected mayor of America’s biggest city and the second Black man to hold the office.\n",
      "\n",
      "US Rep. Ritchie Torres, who represents the Bronx, told CNN the situation is akin to “a Vichy Democrat allowing one of the bluest cities in America to be occupied by a far-right administration,” saying Adams has been rendered ineffectual to the point of being “a zombie mayor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Former Gov. David Paterson, an Adams friend who endorsed him four years ago, told CNN that he just saw the mayor on Thursday, but said as conflicted as he feels, Democratic voters in the city like himself “would certainly not be as comfortable as they were in 2021 when they voted for him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Opponents pounce as Adams unravels\n",
      "A united front against Adams was on display outside of City Hall on a frigid Friday morning as a coalition of advocacy organizations, lawmakers and party leaders gathered to call for his resignation or for Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul to use her powers to remove Adams from office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ana Maria Archila, co-director of the Working Families Party, told CNN the group’s concerns that Adams would use his legal trouble to negotiate against the interest of New Yorkers had materialized.\n",

      "“I think the tide has turned so much that the people’s ability to trust his sound decision making has almost completely eroded,” Archila said.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the primary only four months away, the mayor’s opponents have seized on the opportunity created by Adams’ starring role in Trump’s shake-up of the Department of Justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opponents of the mayor say the Justice Department memo to dismiss the charges against Adams, his move to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement back on Rikers Island and his willingness to assign NYPD officers to help on federal task forces focused on immigration action are all signs he will ignore city law as long as it benefits him and pleases Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, who is running against Adams, told CNN the mayor’s actions allow Trump to “make an example out of New York City,” and show that the biggest city in the country and the president’s hometown is no longer willing to fight against his policies. The result, Mamdani charged, is a mayor who is “a walking emergency.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad Lander, the city’s chief financial watchdog and another mayoral candidate, also had his moment in the spotlight last week after an Elon Musk directive resulted in the clawback of $80 million in Congress-allocated funds from the city’s bank account.\n",

      "“Democrats who are corrupt should face consequences, just like I think Republicans who are corrupt should face consequences,” Lander said. “There is no constituency in the Democratic Party for someone who is serving as an agent of Donald Trump rather than a protector of New Yorkers in City Hall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Scott Stringer, the former city comptroller who ran unsuccessfully against Adams in 2021 and is seeking another shot at leading the city, questioned whether the mayor should continue his pursuit of the Democratic nomination, a move he described as “an absurdity” given Adams’ cooperation with the Trump administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple Democratic members of Congress did not answer when asked directly by CNN whether they believe Adams still has a place in their party. Rep.

      "“This is not the first time that members of the caucus expressed frustration that he wasn’t as inclusive as he could have been on decision making or strategy, but the stakes of this particular vote were huge,” said one Senate Democrat, who like others, is still wary of going public with attacks on the leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "But CNN’s conversations with three-dozen Democratic senators, members of the House, top aides and other prominent leaders detail a cratering of support, with many starting to feel that he can’t be the party’s future and shouldn’t be their present.\n",

      "“If he doesn’t lose it between now and then, he won’t be leader in two years,” said another Democratic senator, who added, looking ahead to the next expected Congressional showdown, “he can’t be trusted alone to negotiate the debt limit.”\n",

      "In a video he blasted out to his supporters Friday night, longtime Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — an independent who caucuses with the Democrats — called the situation “an absolute failure of Democratic leadership.” In a video he blasted out to his own supporters, freshman California Sen. Adam Schiff called it “a bad day for our country – and for the Democratic Party.”\n",

      "“Schumer tried to be too smart,” said another Democratic senator, “but he ended up looking indecisive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Schumer and the nine Democrats who voted with him on Friday say they were making the responsible decision between two horrible choices. Option one: advance a bill full of major cuts and leeway for Trump’s administration to reallocate billions of funds for their own purposes. Option two: enable a shutdown which could have stretched on indefinitely while Trump officials flexed executive authority over spending in ways they would find even more devastating, not to mention leaving tens of thousands of federal workers without pay and millions more without services.\n",
      "\n",
      "But critics from across traditional Democratic divides of ideology, geography and age see a pile of excuses and false choices. They say Schumer flubbed weeks of strategy, essentially negotiating with himself for less to make the final bill worse than they could have gotten it to be with better pushback. They say he mismanaged dynamics internally with colleagues and publicly so that he ended up delivering a fresh round of dejection to a party already slumping on the ropes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any Democrat paying attention knew this week of negotiations was going to be terrible for them. But, many say, it was Schumer’s leadership that left them looking and feeling even worse—and with much less leverage for future fight, now that Senate Republicans saw how easy it was to write what Trump wants into the bills, make no effort to reach out to Democrats, and watch them be the ones to attack each other.\n",

      "“Republicans saw Democrats were weak, and thought, ‘We’re going to call your bluff’—and they were right,” said a top aide to one Senate Democrat. “This was always going to be no-win. But it didn’t have to be this much of an ‘L’.”\n",

      "Losing some faith in the Senate, much more outside the Senate\n",
      "As Trump got exactly the bill he wanted while losing only two Republican votes combined between the House and Senate, Schumer has lost faith among several of his Democratic senators for being able to manage the fights ahead. He left several of his own senators distrusting others in their own caucus. Several Democratic governors, who have privately been knocking Schumer as inept for weeks, finished Friday feeling more validated than they ever wanted to be.\n",

Always deliberate with his words, the only answer the fellow New Yorker would give on Friday when asked by CNN if he thought a change in Senate leadership was needed was, “next question.”\n",

      "Schumer sees what he did, by contrast, as truly grappling with how different Trump is as a president now, versus when they had their showdown fights in his first term. Then, Schumer said repeatedly in conversations, Trump wasn’t looking for pretexts to fire federal government workers. Then, Schumer also said, Republican leaders in Congress were trying to avoid a shutdown, while now he saw them as egging one on in a way that he feared meant they wouldn’t have allowed government to re-open anytime soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once you shut down the government, it is totally up to DOGE and Trump and Musk how long we’re in shutdown,” Schumer said in an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN on Friday evening. “We could have been in shutdown for months, and why did Musk and Trump want to shut down? Because they wanted this power to achieve their goal of dramatically shrinking, destroying, hurting innocent people in the government.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Schumer’s thinking going into the week, several people familiar with it told CNN, was trying to avoid letting House Speaker Mike Johnson use him as a foil—being clearer with his position, the Senate leader thought, would make it easier to line up House Republican votes. He also felt he was giving Jeffries the maximum amount of space to unite against the bill. And he figured this Republican leadership wouldn’t make any real concessions on the bill no matter what he did.\n",
      "\n",
      "For three days in a row leading up to the vote, Schumer held long lunch meetings for the Senate Democrats to air their grievances and opinions about what to do. To many of the senators stewing and steaming through them, this felt like not having a strategy—to the point that one senator, according to a colleague, spoke up to say that even former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, despite being constantly mutinied against by his own Republican colleagues, managed to get a meeting with then-President Joe Biden during their 2023 debt limit fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schumer has told allies he saw these lunches as his strategy, trying to let colleagues coalesce around which of the bad options they felt was worse by arguing with each other, but without his twisting arms either way. He didn’t want a shutdown. He felt like Democrats would lose the political fight over one. But he says he wanted his colleagues to get there themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also called multiple senators into his office to tell them they had to convince particular colleagues to vote yes, and urged several leaders of Democratic-leaning organizations to tamp down their rhetoric pushing for a shutdown.\n",

      "And when Schumer announced his own yes vote, it was not just within a day of floating an alternative strategy—he even surprised one of his closest allies, according to multiple senators: Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee and far from a standard resistance figure. She ended up voting no.\n",
      "\n",
      "House Democrats were bewildered themselves by the suggestion that Schumer was doing them any favors. Several joined the nearly unanimous Democratic vote against the Republican budget bill not because they wanted a shutdown, but because they thought they were giving the Senate more leverage. Others were convinced that they needed to be part of a unified Democratic effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several close to Jeffries himself, meanwhile, scoff at Schumer’s suggesting that House Democrats didn’t think Johnson would pass the bill, arguing the senator doesn’t get how much obedience to Trump has come to define Republicans in Congress. They think Schumer never understood Jeffries’s strategy was to push for the fight since he was convinced Democrats could win, and worried about the policy and political consequences of putting a rubber stamp on the Republican bill.\n",

      "Gillibrand is the chair of the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm for the 2026 elections. After voting yes, despite a detailed justification she argued in a press release from her office on Friday, several of her colleagues and Democratic operatives told CNN they did not see how she could credibly appeal to donors and voters who wanted more of a fight.\n",

      "Others sympathetic to Schumer and Gillibrand argued to CNN that it’s hard to believe the intricacies of a procedural vote in March 2025 will really shape the 2026 midterms, especially because by the fall Democrats are expecting Republicans to push through a bill to enact much of Trump’s agenda that includes sweeping tax cuts and deep spending reductions on programs like Medicare without requiring a single Democratic vote, which they think will unify both Democratic officials and their supporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with Senate Democrats acknowledging they probably don’t have enough opportunities in races to get to the majority even in their best case scenario for 2026, they are hoping to get there by 2028. By then, Schumer would be 77, in Washington for as long as Joe Biden had been when he was elected president, and have weathered years of compromises with Trump.

      "As Joe Manchin prepares to leave Congress after nearly 15 years, the West Virginia senator — who left the Democratic Party and registered as an independent earlier this year — is further distancing himself from his former party, calling the Democratic brand “toxic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The D-brand has been so maligned from the standpoint of, it’s just, it’s toxic,” Manchin told CNN’s Manu Raju in an interview that aired Sunday, citing the shift as the reason why he left the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding that he no longer considers himself a Democrat “in the form of what Democratic Party has turned itself into,” Manchin — who has long been a pivotal swing vote in the Senate — said the party’s brand has become about telling people what they can and can’t do, blaming progressives for the change.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They have basically expanded upon thinking, ‘Well, we want to protect you there, but we’re going to tell you how you should live your life from that far on,’” Manchin added.\n",

      "\n",
      "“This country is not going left,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former West Virginia governor-turned-senator shared that he was a lifelong Democrat because the party used to focus on kitchen-table issues such as “good job, a good pay,” but claimed Democrats are now too worried about sensitive social issues, such as transgender rights, while taking “no responsibility at all” for the federal budget during the election.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Manchin said Republicans don’t take responsibility for the national debt either, criticizing them further for lacking common sense on the issue of guns.\n",

      "When asked about incoming House Progressive Caucus Chair Greg Casar’s remarks that Democrats would have won the election if the party was more like outgoing caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal and less like Manchin, the senator told Raju: “For someone to say that, they’ve got to be completely insane.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The people in America voted,” Manchin said. “They had that opportunity, you know, to vote with Kamala Harris and with Donald Trump. Donald Trump, there’s not much hasn’t been said. You know exactly what you’re getting. He hasn’t made any bones about it.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Sharing that he had tried to explore a run with the centrist group No Labels, Manchin said he realized that “I have no chance of winning if I can’t participate in all 50 states.”\n",

      "“The centrist-moderate vote decides who’s going to be the president of the United States. And when they get here, they don’t govern that way. Neither side does.

      "Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom is no stranger to going against the grain on significant social issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four years before California voters passed a ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage in 2008, then-San Francisco Mayor Newsom instructed the city clerk to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, defying federal law and solidifying his reputation as a longtime ally of the LGBTQ community.\n",
      "\n",
      "That history was top of mind for several Democrats last week, when the governor said in his new podcast that transgender girls and women participating in female sports leagues is “deeply unfair.” The comments made him the most prominent Democrat to buck the party and echo public opinion on an issue that helped shape the 2024 election and could be a political liability once more in 2028.\n",
      "\n",
      "The episode quickly made good on the promise of the podcast, advertised as a place where the governor would “answer the hard questions.” Chief among those: Are there limits to the party’s support for transgender Americans?\n",
      "\n",
      "“The issue of fairness is completely legit,” Newsom said on “This Is Gavin Newsom” last week. “And we’ve got to own that. We’ve got to acknowledge it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats have spent the last several years pushing back on a wave of anti-transgender bills and rhetoric led by Republicans, including Donald Trump, who made banning transgender athletes from women’s sports a key part of his 2024 campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most Democrats have been steadfast in their opposition to restricting or rolling back transgender rights. But in the wake of Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss, millions in attack ads and public polling showing a majority of Americans disagree with Democrats on transgender athletes, some members of the party are acknowledging the political dilemma facing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "A January New York Times/Ipsos poll found that 79% of Americans — including 67% of Democrats — said they believed female transgender athletes should not be allowed to play on women’s sports teams. A Pew Research poll released last month found that 66% of Americans favor laws that require transgender girls and women to play on the teams of the gender they were assigned at birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same poll also found that 56% of Americans favor laws that prevent discrimination against transgender Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many Democrats, the debate was heightened in the aftermath of Harris’ loss, and the outsize impact of a Trump campaign ad that highlighted her past support for gender-affirming surgery for prison inmates. “Kamala’s agenda is they/them, President Trump is for you,” one ad said. Further down the ballot, Democratic Senate candidates Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Colin Allred of Texas, both of whom lost their races, also faced ads focusing on transgender girls in sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "One Democratic strategist who has worked on California campaigns said the party shouldn’t change its positions on transgender issues, but rather rethink how it discusses them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve said this to my clients a million times: You get to decide what you talk about, when you talk about it, and how you talk about it,” the strategist said. “And if we’re talking about the trans community, we should do the same thing we did with the broader LGBT community, which is talk about it in ways that are relatable to people who don’t understand what it means to be trans.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In Washington, Democrats have remained mostly united on transgender rights issues, while attempting to shift their messaging. Only two House Democrats voted to approve legislation to restrict transgender girls and women from playing in many female sports leagues. No Senate Democrats voted to advance the same measure, which failed last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, argued that decisions about whether transgender girls should be allowed to participate in female sports leagues should be decided at the local level, where parents and players can participate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While Republicans are focused on playing politics with children’s sports leagues, I’m focused on the issue that I hear about from constituents every day. I’m focused on lowering household costs,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Newsom, meanwhile, attempted to straddle a line between supporting transgender athletes broadly while also echoing Republican arguments on fairness.\n",

      "“The way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with. So, both things I can hold in my hand,” Newsom said on the podcast, which featured conservative activist Charlie Kirk. “How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that, I think, is inherent in you, but not always expressed on the issue, but at the same time, deal with the unfairness?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the interview, Newsom noted how “devastating” the “they/them” ad was for Harris, specifically references to her past support for taxpayer-funded gender-affirming surgery for detained migrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She didn’t even react to it, which was even more devastating,” Newsom said, later adding: “This was even more challenging because it’s issues of people who are incarcerated … illegal, incarcerated individuals getting taxpayer-funded, gender reassignment surgery. That is a 90/10, not an 80/20.”\n",

      "LGBTQ groups strongly condemned Newsom’s comments calling it “deeply unfair” for transgender athletes to play in women’s sports leagues, even as they praised him for being a longtime ally. The leaders of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus, which unveiled a slate of transgender rights bills in the state legislature earlier this month, said they were “profoundly sickened and frustrated” by Newsom’s comments.\n",

      "“I’m not going to speculate on his strategy here, but I do know, in running for public office that you use addition, right? You try to earn more votes, and I see this as actually a net loss,” Democratic California Assemblymember Chris Ward, the chair of the caucus, told CNN. “People who are already decided on this issue are probably also pretty decided on him.”\n",

      "Rob Stutzman, a Republican strategist based in California, described Newsom’s podcast as an effort to “abandon his posture of resistance” and find a new political lane. But he also agreed with the substance of what the governor said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Democrats are on the wrong end of an 80/20 issue when it comes to this, so I think he’s right,” Stutzman said. “I don’t think the timing is courageous.”\n",

      "Newsom, a possible 2028 presidential candidate who campaigned for former President Joe Biden and Harris, is the most high-profile Democrat to shift on transgender athletes, but not the first. After the November election, Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat, said his party spent too much time trying not to offend people instead of being “brutally honest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that,” Moulton told The New York Times in November.\n",

      "“It took 120 days for a fellow Democrat to come out and agree with me publicly, even though I’ve had countless colleagues come up to me privately and say, ‘Yeah, you’re right on this and Democrats just need to get real,’” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” on Friday. “The right thing to do is to engage in these issues and listen to 80% of Americans when they say this is a problem.”\n",

      "In recent years, Republicans across the country have introduced hundreds of bills restricting transgender rights, including measures on youth sports, gender-affirming care, access to public restrooms and ID changes.

      "New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday that she plans to mobilize her massive base of followers to oppose what she described as an “acquiesce” by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to accept the House GOP funding bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal,” Ocasio-Cortez told reporters in Leesburg, Virginia, where House Democrats are huddling for their annual policy retreat. She said she and her fellow Democrats are “texting, calling, sending carrier pigeons,” to mobilize the Democratic base against Schumer’s plan to allow the GOP funding bill to advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "And she slammed Senate Democrats for their decision to “completely roll over and give up on protecting the Constitution.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked whether Senate Democrats need new leadership, Ocasio-Cortez would say only that she is focused on how to prevent her party from accepting the GOP bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have time to correct course on this decision. Senate Democrats can vote no. We can correct course, and that is the most important thing in front of us right now,” Ocasio-Cortez said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The New York Democrat has been among the most vocal Democratic officials nationwide in the push against the House GOP funding bill. Using her social accounts, Ocasio-Cortez has urged fellow Democrats across the country to exert maximum pressure on their own senators on the funding bill, which is the first major point of leverage in President Donald Trump’s second term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Privately, House Democrats are so infuriated with Schumer’s decision that some have begun encouraging her to run against Schumer in a primary, according to a Democratic member who directly spoke with Ocasio-Cortez about running at the caucus’ policy retreat. Multiple Democrats in the Congressional Progressive Caucus and others directly encouraged Ocasio-Cortez to run on Thursday night after Schumer’s announcement, this member said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The member said that Democrats in Leesburg were “so mad” that even centrist Democrats were “ready to write checks for AOC for Senate,” adding that they have “never seen people so mad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked by CNN about fellow Democrats encouraging her to challenge Schumer, Ocasio-Cortez declined to answer and said she was focused on keeping Democrats from backing the funding bill: “We still have an opportunity to correct course here, and that is my number one priority.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But speaking to reporters, Ocasio-Cortez did not hold back on her criticism of Senate Democrats for backing out of a vote that all but one battleground House Democrat was willing to take.\n",

      "“There are members of Congress who have won Trump-held districts in some of the most difficult territory in the United States who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people, in order to defend Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare,” she said. “Just to see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think is a huge slap in the face.

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The polar opposite story is playing out among Democrats. After years of mostly good vibes about the economy, consumer sentiment among Democrats tumbled in December to the lowest level since the summer of 2022, when gas prices were near $5 a gallon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s really striking to see how people perceive the world so differently,” said Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n",

      "The post-election shift in the economic perceptions of Republicans and Democrats is not shocking. A similar story has played out following previous changes in power in the White House, including after the 2016 and 2020 elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the magnitude of the shift is startling, and researchers say it reflects the county’s political polarization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider that as recently as September, consumer sentiment among Republicans stood at a weak level of just 50, according to the University of Michigan. It has since surged to nearly 82.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentiment among Democrats stood at 91 as recently as October. But it has since plunged to 71.\n",

      "Expectations spike for Republicans\n",
      "Perceptions about current economic conditions haven’t changed dramatically. And that makes sense because the situation on the ground hasn’t changed much, except perhaps in the booming stock market or the value of bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, the election has jolted views about what comes next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer expectations among Democrats have plummeted by nearly 50% since October to the lowest levels since the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the University of Michigan. Expectations among Republicans have nearly doubled over that span to four-and-a-half-year highs.\n",

      "Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, said voters are recalibrating their feelings based on their views of Trump’s economic agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is not just a matter of voters waving the flag of their favorite team,” Hsu told CNN. “It’s not that they belong to different realities. They are looking at the same reality. They just don’t agree on the implications of policies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sticker shock worries\n",
      "Hsu told CNN that 20% of consumers in the December survey spontaneously mentioned tariffs, and people who mentioned tariffs have much worse expectations for business conditions. Two months ago, just 2% of people spontaneously mentioned tariffs, a key plan of Trump’s economic platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Democrats believe tariffs will lead to a resurgence of inflation. Republicans believe there will be a massive inflation slowdown,” said Hsu, a former economist at the Federal Reserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many mainstream economists have warned that Trump’s plans to impose sweeping tariffs on friends and allies will increase consumer prices — perhaps significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has already threatened to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada on his first day in office, as well as lift existing tariffs on China. Trump has also threatened to spike tariffs to 100% on Russia, Brazil, China and other BRICS nations if they try to challenge the dominance of the US dollar.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Trump’s tariffs looming, the University of Michigan survey revealed a spike in perceived buying conditions for durable goods, big-ticket items like refrigerators, cars and other products meant to last.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is not a sign of strength. People think it’s a better time to buy durables because they are expecting prices to skyrocket next year — and they want to avoid that,” said Hsu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Republicans, on the other hand, don’t think it’s a good time to buy durables, Hsu said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer spending powers the economy\n",
      "Trump has repeatedly argued that his unprecedented trade agenda will not reignite inflation. And his defenders have portrayed his tariff threats as part of a negotiating strategy, not necessarily what will ultimately take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the University of Michigan survey found that year-ahead inflation expectations across all consumers increased in December to six-month highs, though they remain well below recent highs.\n",

      "Although partisan splits in consumer sentiment have existed since at least the Reagan administration, Hsu said they became more pronounced under Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "In theory, these gaps could have significant consequences for the US economy, which is driven in large part by consumer spending. If one part of the country hunkers down and slashes spending at the mall or on vacations, that would hurt businesses and lead to layoffs.\n",

      "The real obstacle for Trump’s campaign against DEI isn’t Democrats. It’s demography\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysis by Ronald Brownstein, CNN\n",
      "\n",
      "The escalating drive from President Donald Trump and other Republicans against programs to promote greater diversity in education and employment is on a collision course with fundamental changes in the nation’s demographic make-up, particularly among the young.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conservative opponents of diversity initiatives have clearly seized the momentum in the policy debate. In 2023, the six Republican-appointed Supreme Court Justices joined in a decisive ruling to virtually eliminate the consideration of race of college admissions. Since taking office, Trump has followed with a flurry of executive orders to end “diversity, equity and inclusion” programs within the federal government and to penalize private employers that utilize them — even to the point of potentially seeking criminal prosecutions. Facing this pressure, prominent companies in recent months have publicly renounced efforts to increase diversity in hiring or contracting. Democrats have been tentative and divided over how hard to push back against the conservative drive to eradicate the so-called DEI programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this diversity counteroffensive is advancing precisely as kids of color have become a solid majority of the nation’s youth. Since the start of the 21st century, young Whites have been rapidly declining not only as a share of the overall youth population, but also in their absolute numbers — to an extent possibly unprecedented in American history. This tectonic reshaping of the American population means that demography, not Democrats, will likely emerge as the biggest obstacle to Trump’s campaign to uproot DEI programs across US society.\n",
      "\n",
      "These demographic trends ensure that in the years ahead, the nation will increasingly rely on non-White young people as an increasing portion of its students, workers and taxpayers. Yet today, minority young people remain tremendously underrepresented at the most exclusive colleges and universities and in high-level, well-paying jobs across the private sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abandoning diversity programs even as the nation continues to grow more diverse could expose US society to two distinct risks. One is that as minorities make up a growing share of the future workforce, failing to equip more of them with advanced academic and technical skills could leave the nation short of the highly trained workers it will need as it transitions further into the information-age economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The future of the nation’s labor force productivity and economic well-being will rely heavily on the success and integration of today’s and tomorrow’s increasingly multiracial younger population,” William Frey, a demographer at the center-left Brookings Metro think tank, wrote recently.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other big risk is that under current trends the US could harden into a more overtly two-tier society, with a widening gap between the growing overall presence of minorities in the population and their limited representation in the most prestigious educational and employment opportunities. That could be a formula for even more social turbulence and alienation than the US has already experienced around current racial disparities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pushback against diversity programs “is an attempt to entrench racial discrimination and disparities at every level of society and to horde power and influence among what will soon be a minority population of White people and the wealthy,” said Janai Nelson, president and director-counsel of the Legal Defense Fund, a leading civil rights organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Relegating … marginalized groups to second-class citizenship will upend the American experiment of multiracial democracy and reinstate a caste system — and that is the point. Indeed, if unchecked, these efforts will create levels of disenfranchisement and disillusionment yet unseen in our modern history,” Nelson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opponents of diversity programs argue there’s no reason for concern even if White people hold on to most of the prestigious educational and employment opportunities as their overall numbers shrink. “I think we need to get away from being concerned about the skin color of those who are occupying those positions,” said Jonathan Butcher, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “I think we need to move to a point where we are concerned about what the individuals accomplish once they are there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But civil rights advocates argue Trump and his allies are brewing a recipe for both social and economic strain by hobbling efforts to expand opportunities for minorities exactly as they represent more of the nation’s future workforce. To these critics, the drive by Trump and his Republican allies to dismantle diversity programs at this transitional moment amounts to raising the castle walls of privilege against a rising tide of demographic change.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If institutional gatekeepers don’t ensure equal access to opportunity, this country will become even more dangerously stratified by race and future generations of Americans will be wholly incapable of meeting the challenges of an increasingly global landscape,” said Nelson. “This is a recipe for disaster.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In this century, the change in the demographic composition of America’s youth population has been swift and sustained. Kids of color increased their share of the nation’s total under-18 population from 39.1% in 2000 to 51.6% in 2023, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data provided to CNN by Frey.\n",
      "\n",
      "This change has been broadly felt. Over that period, the minority share of the youth population has increased in all 50 states, according to Frey’s calculations. In 18 states, kids of color already constitute more than half of the youth population. In six other states, minority kids make up at least 46% of the youth population, suggesting they will become the majority group before long.\n",
      "\n",
      "The change in the absolute numbers of the youth population may be even more revealing than these shifts in its proportions. Since 2000, the number of non-White kids has increased by just over 9.3 million, Frey found. Over that same period, the number of White kids has declined by nearly 8.8 million. In 47 of the 50 states, not only has the share of Whites younger than 18 declined since 2000, but so has their absolute number. The only states that have more White kids today than at the turn of the 21st century are Utah, Idaho and South Carolina — and even they have seen only small increases, totaling about 120,000 between them. By contrast, 30 states have at least 75,000 fewer White kids today than they did in 2000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frey has calculated from Census data that the number of White kids shrank from 2000 to 2010 and from 2010 to 2020, and continued to fall from 2020 to 2023. He says there is likely no precedent in American history for such an extended decline in the number of White young people. Something similar may have happened “during the Great Depression for a few years,” Frey told me. “That’s possible. But for most of our history as a country we’ve been growing. It’s fair to say that this is the first time we’ve seen a decline like this for this length of time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor does Frey see much possibility that the decline in both the share and absolute number of White kids will reverse any time soon. “I don’t see this decline reversing, because the White population is older and women in their child-bearing ages are getting to be a smaller share of that group,” Frey told me. Immigration, he adds, isn’t likely to add many more White kids since most legal migrants, come from predominantly non-White countries. The Census projects the minority share of the youth population will reach 53% by 2030 and 60% by 2050.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this guarantees that non-White kids will represent the principal source of workers for the 21st-century economy. As recently as 2000, White kids still represented nearly 70% of all high school graduates, according to the federal National Center for Education Statistics. But in the 2021-22 school year, young White people, for the first time, fell below the majority of high school graduates (at 49.4%), and their share has continued to tumble: The National Center projects that Whites will slip to 46% of all high school graduates next June and to as little as 43% of the graduating class in 2031. The NCES projects that 300,000 fewer White kids will graduate high school this year than in 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enrollment in postsecondary education is moving along the same track. The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce reported in a study last year that the number of White students attending colleges and universities plummeted by 375,000 from 2009 to 2019, the latest year for which they calculated detailed figures by race; the number of Black students tumbled by nearly 100,000 as well. All the growth in postsecondary attendance over that period came from Latino students (up about 190,000) and, to a much lesser, extent Asian Americans (up nearly 20,000).\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet kids of color continue to face systemic inequities at each stage of the journey from education into the workforce. Research, for instance, has consistently shown that student performance lags in elementary and secondary schools where poverty is pervasive; today, about three-fourths of Black and Latino students, compared to only about one-third of their Asian American and White counterparts, attend schools where at least half of students qualify as poor under federal definitions, according to the National Equity Atlas published by PolicyLink, a research and advocacy group, and the Equity Research Institute at the University of Southern California.\n",
      "\n",
      "Higher education likewise remains substantially stratified by race. About two-thirds of both Black and Latino students, Georgetown found, attend so-called open-access colleges, which are the least competitive in admissions and spend less than half the money and employ less than half the faculty per student as more selective schools. Though Black, Latino and Native American students have grown to 37% of the total postsecondary student body, they hold only 21% of the seats in roughly the 500 most selective schools. White and Asian American students, by contrast, still constitute nearly three-fourths of all those attending the most selective institutions, the Georgetown center found, far beyond their three-in-five share of the total postsecondary student population. While about four-fifths of students at the selective colleges finish their degrees, that’s true for less than half of those at the open-access institutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Open-access institutions educate the vast majority of college students, but, unfortunately, do so with the fewest resources and have the lowest success rates,” the Georgetown Center concluded in its 2024 report. “The American postsecondary system, in other words, tends to provide the highest-quality education to those who need it least: students who are primarily wealthier than the median and who attended well-resourced high schools that smooth the transition into the most-selective colleges.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This pipeline of educational inequality ultimately terminates in widely unequal outcomes in the job market. The average hourly wages of Black and Latino workers remain about 11% lower than the wages for White workers — a wider gap than in 1979 for both minority groups, according to an analysis of federal data by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. Ben Zipperer, an EPI senior economist, has calculated that although Whites make up about 58% of all workers, they represent 68% of those whose wages put them in the top fifth of highest earners. Black and Latino workers, though nearly one-third of all workers, are just a little more than one-sixth of those at the top, wage-wise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nelson of the LDF points to other measures of enduring inequality. Across the 100 largest companies listed on the S&P stock index, Black, Latino and Asian Americans hold less than one-fourth of upper management jobs, according to a Harvard Law School analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Black and Latinx people,” she added, “make up fewer than 1% and 2% of Venture Capital entrepreneurs, respectively, according to a Harvard Business School analysis.” Despite some gains, women remain significantly underrepresented on both fronts, too, she noted. Though women obtain about 60% of all four-year undergraduate degrees and nearly two-thirds of all post-graduate degrees, the Harvard Law analysis found they hold only slightly more than one in four of those upper management jobs in large companies, little more than racial minorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Less precisely quantifiable, but potentially just as important, these educational inequities also yield enduring racial disparities in what could be called the C-suite of American life —the positions that wield decision-making power in our major public and private institutions. Zack Mabel, director of research at the Georgetown Center, notes that the elite universities where Black and Latino students remain systematically underrepresented have long functioned as the conveyor belt producing most of the people who occupy those roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s so much concentrated power in decision making that grows up out of these selective institutions and as a society I would argue we are in desperate need of diversifying access to those bastions of power,” Mabel said. “The only realistic way we are going to do that is by diversifying our selective institutions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these entrenched disparities, polls for years have shown that most Americans, including many racial minorities, express opposition to “affirmative action” or diversity programs that explicitly elevate racial considerations above ostensibly neutral concepts of merit in employment or college admissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "And after a campaign in which Trump relentlessly attacked diversity efforts, his election day gains compared to 2020 among Latinos, Asian Americans and Black men, demonstrated at the least that his hostility to such programs was not a deal-breaker for many non-White voters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Trump’s gains with non-White voters didn’t surprise him. Trump’s improvement on that front showed that the argument over diversity programs “is part of the elite discourse that working- and lower-middle-class families of color typically aren’t that bought into,” Cox said. “Your average working-class kid, the idea of going to Harvard is like the idea of going to the moon. It’s a long shot; that’s not the thing that is going to be life-changing or game-changing for them. Better opportunities where they live, cheaper housing where they live, lower crime — those are the things that are going to be game-changing for them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manuel Pastor, director of the Equity Research Institute at USC, agreed that Trump’s gains with minority voters came in part because diversity programs in education and employment don’t “always reach working-class people of color in real, concrete material ways.” And Pastor believes that the backlash against diversity programs intensified because too many morphed into formulaic workplace trainings that “became often more symbolic and about discourse and how about how people feel than they were about recognizing historic disparities and giving people a leg up into the workplace.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, Pastor argues, none of that erases the core demographic reality that the US will increasingly rely for its future workers on kids of color who are on the wrong end of compounding disparities in educational and employment opportunity. Abandoning diversity programs now, he argues, “means wasted talent. It means lost Einsteins. It means not investing in the productivity that we need for the future.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Like other critics of diversity programs, Butcher, the Heritage Foundation senior fellow, argues that trying to channel more minority students into elite educational institutions “is a dangerous policy to engineer from the top. I think there is no centralized control or bureaucracy that could effectively engineer those kinds of outcomes without serious unintended consequences.” Even if the rollback of diversity programs widens the gap between White and non-White young people, Butcher said, “I don’t believe that just because there would be different outcomes for individuals based on race that it necessarily represents racism.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Amid the furious counteroffensive against diversity programs from conservatives wielding such arguments, defenders of these efforts are likely to shift their arguments over time more from equity to economic grounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the defining demographic realities of modern America is the enormous racial divergence between America’s youngest and oldest generations, a dynamic Frey has called the “cultural generation gap” and I’ve described as the contrast between “the brown and the gray.” Even as minorities have grown into a majority of the youth population, and advance toward becoming most of the working-age population, about three-fourths of seniors remain White (primarily because the US virtually shut off immigration from 1924 to 1965).\n",
      "\n",
      "This racial transformation has been occurring even as the number of seniors, as Frey has documented, has been growing more than nine times as fast as the working-age population. That means, to pay the payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare, a rapidly growing population of White seniors will depend on a workforce that is increasing only modestly in numbers but rapidly becoming more diverse.\n",
      "\n",
      "That creates a shared interest across racial and generational lines that is rarely discussed in American politics. If kids of color continue to face the educational disparities evident today, the danger isn’t just that the economy overall will face shortages of skilled workers as those kids become a larger share of the future workforce. Ultimately, the mostly White senior population also needs more kids of color to ascend into well-paying jobs where they can be taxed to meet the growing cost of the big federal programs for the elderly. Ending diversity programs now increases the risk that the US will fail to produce as many skilled minority workers as it needs on both fronts, advocates argue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The people we overlook for investments is going to shipwreck the future for America writ large, but especially for a whiter, older retired population that is counting on this (diverse) younger population to contribute” to their retirement costs, Pastor said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frey said that sooner or later, the US will recognize that it must open more educational and employment opportunities for non-White young people because there simply will not be enough White kids available to fill all the skilled jobs the economy will demand. “To talk about getting rid of DEI is just being blind to demography,” Frey says. “Sooner or later, we are going to run out of (White) people even in those top jobs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, though, the politics of diversity are now moving in the opposite direction of the demographic and economic imperatives of an irreversibly diversifying nation.\n",

      "If you’re looking for a reason why Vice President Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump, there are plenty to choose from. Many of Harris’ reeling supporters are still trying to understand the forces behind Trump’s win. Trump won less than half of the popular vote, where his margin of victory was smaller than President Biden’s in 2020. Still, he swept all seven swing states and he has forced Democrats to ask what they must do to reach more working-class and Latino voters.\n",
      "\n",
      "One prominent evangelical pastor offers some insight. The Rev. William J. Barber II has long been one of America’s most persistent and eloquent spokespersons for poor and working-class Americans. Barber, who has been called “the closest person we have to MLK” in contemporary America, has organized coalitions of the poor, working-class Whites and people of color around such causes as raising the minimum wage, expanding health care and strengthening unions. Barber is the recipient of a MacArthur “genius grant” and helps lead the Poor People’s Campaign, which seeks national solutions to ongoing poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barber also has done something else: He’s shown Democrats how they can win political victories in red states. Barber is currently the founding director of the Center for Public Theology and Public Policy at Yale Divinity School and Repairers of the Breach, a group that trains social justice leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he made his mark from his home state of North Carolina. As one of the architects of the “Moral Mondays” movement, he helped lead a racially diverse coalition that is credited with toppling a Republican governor and turning North Carolina into a swing state. Though Harris lost North Carolina, Democrats in 2024 won races for governor and attorney general, and the GOP appears likely to lose its veto-proof majority in the state legislature.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Democrats debating how best to reach new voters, Barber’s perspective could be valuable. He has written a blueprint for expanding the Democratic base in North Carolina and elsewhere through what he calls “fusion politics,” a multiracial and multiclass coalition that transcends the conservative-vs.-progressive binary. Racism is often depicted as a Black problem, but Barber insists it’s also been used throughout US history to hurt the economic interests of everyday White people. He once said, “Racism may target Black people, but it damns a democracy, and it damns humanity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN spoke with Barber about the country’s future in Trump’s impending second term. In his rumbling preacher’s baritone, Barber explained why he thinks both political parties fail the working class, how the Democratic Party can move forward and why he still believes America can become a genuine multiracial democracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "His answers were edited for clarity and brevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Were you shocked by the election results?\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know if shocked is the word. I’m deeply concerned for this country. I’m deeply disappointed that you could have someone who spews as much violence and viciousness, a sexual abuser (a federal jury found last year in a civil case that Trump sexually abused a woman in 1996 in New York City) who clearly doesn’t believe in the rule of law. He lies, curses and creates an enemy list. If Vice President Harris had done a half of one of those things, her poll numbers would have dropped and she would have not even been able to stay in the race. Trump is able to do it, and somehow so many Americans look the other way.\n",
      "\n",
      "For people to say they still support him, there’s something deeply wrong with a large section of the country. And then what’s really shocking to me is the number of people who still choose not to vote. What is it about our society that we can see someone who leans into fascism, and there is not an all-out effort to get to the polls and say no?\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s your answer to that question? What is it about people that saw all this and still didn’t vote?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think people get turned off because they feel as though politics is just a game of the rich and things are not going to really change. From one study, we found out that 30 million poor and low-wage people did not vote because they said nobody talked to them. Nobody talked to their issues. If you look at the two (2024 presidential and vice-presidential) debates, not one candidate was asked how would their policies affect the issues of people dying every day from poverty and low wages. Not one candidate was asked would they raise the minimum wage, which we’ve not raised for 15 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The debates write a lot of people off. They (low-income viewers) don’t hear their names, they don’t hear their conditions. So our discourse, or lack thereof, is causing more and more people to just remove themselves (from the political process). We have a lot of questions to ask about our soul and mindset in this culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Critics say Democrats are elitist and look down on working-class people. What do you say to that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither party has done enough, and all of them dismiss poor and low-wage service people in different ways. The Republicans tend to say poverty and low wage is your own fault. And then they try to racialize poverty and make it like it’s a Black issue. When they talk about poverty, the first thing they do is show a Black woman with food stamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other side, Democrats think that they can just talk “middle class.” They don’t have to say “poverty.” They don’t have to say “low wages.” They fall in the trap of allowing poverty to be marginalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats — I don’t know if I would use the word elitism — they just haven’t done what could have been done when they had the opportunity. I go back to the fact that the $15 (minimum wage) was a part of the Covid relief package. It was taken out of the package and it was allowed to be voted on individually but some so-called moderate Democrats said no to it at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a deep moral problem in this country. We’re just writing off a whole swath of people. We begged and pushed and marched and demanded that there’d be a roundtable in the White House, bringing in poor, low-wage people from Appalachia and Alabama to face this issue. We said the Senate should have a vote on a living wage before the election and make people like (Vice President-elect) JD Vance vote and say where they stand right before the election so the American people could know. There’s not a battleground state where poor and low-wage people don’t make up more than 40% of the electorate. There’s not a battleground state where if just 10% of poor, low-wage people were to vote around an agenda that they wouldn’t fundamentally shift the outcome of the election.\n",

      "There are people who say it’s a mistake to reduce Trump’s victory to racism or sexism because large numbers of Latino men voted for Trump. What role do you think racism and sexism played in the election result?\n",
      "\n",
      "Racism certainly is a part of it. But you got to go beyond just race because 66 million poor, low-wage folks are White, and they vote for policies that hurt them as well. You have to look at the level of chauvinism in the election. We’ve had two highly qualified women (Hillary Clinton in 2016; Harris in 2024), both better people (than Trump) in terms of character and policy, lose to Trump and the MAGA movement.\n",

      "In North Carolina, you had a Democrat — the governor, the lieutenant governor, the superintendent of schools, the attorney general — win (in 2024).

He played “Birth of a Nation” (the 1915 silent film that featured racist depictions of Black people while glorifying the Ku Klux Klan, which Wilson screened at the White House). But the point I’m making is people were hurt. He lied to the Black community. He got elected, he started wanting to turn back all kinds of (civil rights) laws. The Supreme Court voted to begin separate but equal (the notorious “Plessy v. Ferguson” decision that legitimated Jim Crow laws). But what did people do? They hurt, they grieved and then they got up and fought.\n",

It is not a moment to say this is all of America. All of America’s voice wasn’t even heard (in this election). We can’t blame it all on Trump. If less people voted, we got to own that. A democracy demands engagement. It’s built on “we the people.” Checking out is how extremists get elected.\n",

And remember: the reconstructionists didn’t just quit or lose. People were beaten down, cheated and assassinated. But I believe in the possibility of a Third Reconstruction. Out all of this grief and struggle we’ve seen, it’s going to cause a massive pushback. I know the history of folk who tend to wield injustice. They always go too far. And they end up producing their own resistance.\n",

      "\n",
      "Led by the Uncommitted National Movement, they spent months pushing and pleading with the Biden administration to scale back its support for Israel’s war in Gaza. Their warning had been consistent and direct: Not only did Democrats risk collapsing support among Arab American and Muslim voters in Michigan, but the conflict – and the continuous flow of military aid to the Israeli government – could depress enthusiasm among the coalition of young, mostly progressive-minded voters who proved key to Joe Biden’s victory in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We told them that the impact of Gaza was going be bigger than just the Arab community. It’s why the turnout was lower in college areas and among young Black voters,” said James Zogby, co-founder of the Arab American Institute and a Democratic National Committee member for more than 30 years. “From the polling we’ve been doing over the last year, we saw it had an impact. And it certainly had an impact on my community.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Early post-election analysis of the race suggests that those concerns were well-founded – and emblematic of a broader disconnect between party leaders and the Democratic grassroots. Arab Americans, like Latino and Black men, all moved toward Trump in the final accounting. The president-elect’s vote-share improved nearly everywhere, from the red states he’s dominated for nearly a decade to traditionally liberal electorates, where Democrats either stayed home or, to a lesser degree, backed third-party candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While Kamala Harris was ignoring communities, especially of Muslim Arab communities here in Dearborn,” Uncommitted co-founder Lexis Zeidan told CNN, Trump “was coming to these communities and pandering to these communities, and he was capitalizing off of these vulnerable emotions and telling them what they wanted to hear.”\n",

      "Wa’el Alzayat, CEO of the Muslim American advocacy organization Emgage, guessed that Harris’ Muslim support might have come in as high as 90% if she had clearly signaled plans to break from Biden’s policy in the region.

      "\n",
      "Since Biden took office, the Department of Education has approved several massive group discharges for borrowers who attended for-profit college networks – like Corinthian Colleges, the University of Phoenix and The Art Institutes – and it has taken longer than expected to process some of the debt relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 135,600 former Corinthian students who were approved for debt relief were still waiting for their loans to be discharged as of this fall, according to a court filing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Processing the discharges for the remaining borrowers has “proven more complicated” partly because they have consolidated loans, it said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There could be more borrowers waiting for cancellations, as well as refunds for amounts previously paid. A group of more than 70 Democrats asked the department to “immediately process debt relief for these borrowers” in a letter sent in early December.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relief was approved under the borrower defense to repayment program, which grants debt discharges for borrowers who were misled by their colleges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if the discharges are not processed before the change in administration, lawyers expect that the Department of Education will still be required to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eileen Connor, president and director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending, which represents borrowers defrauded by their colleges, noted that the first Trump administration processed debt relief approved by the Obama administration.\n",

      "That said, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos approved the cancellations, she wrote she was doing so “with extreme displeasure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Approve more student loan forgiveness through borrower defense\n",
      "Some lawmakers are urging the Department of Education to approve additional group discharges under borrower defense. They say there are other schools that have been found to have committed fraud or misled students, making some other former students eligible for relief under borrower defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s some concern that the incoming Trump administration could change the rules of borrower defense and slow down the processing of pending claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If they have their way, it will be significantly harder – and potentially impossible – for these borrowers to receive relief under the Trump-Vance Administration,” Rep. Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat and raking member on the House Education and Workforce Committee, wrote in a separate letter to the department last month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the first Trump administration, the Department of Education also attempted to change the borrower defense rules to limit the relief that could be delivered through the program. The proposal was unsuccessful, but the department stopped processing borrower defense claims while fighting challenges in court. As a result, a backlog of more than 200,000 claims piled up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Provide options for borrowers stuck in legal limbo\n",
      "Democrats are also pushing the Department of Education to make it easier for about 8 million borrowers who are enrolled in a plan that’s currently on hold due to litigation to make payments and qualify for debt relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan, known as the SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education), was launched by the Biden administration last year. But it’s being challenged in court by two groups of Republican-led states that argue the president does not have the authority to implement the plan. A ruling by the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals is expected imminently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Borrowers enrolled in SAVE are not currently required to make payments since the Department of Education put them in an interest-free forbearance due to the litigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the pause on payments is good news for many of the impacted borrowers, it could potentially delay student loan forgiveness for some of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s because the time in forbearance will not count toward the number of payments required to be eligible for debt relief under programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which wipes away remaining debt for eligible public-sector workers — like teachers and nurses — after they make 120 qualifying payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of last week, the Department of Education said that borrowers were allowed to switch into two older repayment plans – Pay As You Earn, or PAYE, and Income-Contingent Repayment, or ICR – in order to resume making payments that count toward debt relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scott also urged the department to process any PSLF discharges for borrowers who may have recently reached 120 qualifying payments.\n",

      "His venture may seem far out, but asteroid mining CEO Matt Gialich has no illusions. The engineer cofounded the bold California startup AstroForge in 2022 with the aim of hunting for precious metals in space, and he is all too aware that success is not guaranteed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, quite frankly, he’s afraid.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m f**king terrified,” Gialich told CNN in a video interview earlier this month. “That’s the honest truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But fear, Gialich emphasized, is an element of the job that he believes AstroForge should embrace as the company prepares to launch its robotic spacecraft, Odin, on an asteroid flyby mission that will mark the company’s first attempt to scout for platinum in space.\n",
      "\n",
      "The probe is set to lift off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on February 26.\n",
      "\n",
      "AstroForge’s spacecraft will ride alongside Athena, a lunar lander developed by the startup Intuitive Machines, until it breaks off on its own. Gialich said Odin should reach the far side of the moon in just five days but will spend another roughly 300 days in the celestial void, waiting to make a close approach to its target asteroid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, the spacecraft — which is roughly the size of a window air-conditioning unit — was developed in just the past 10 months. Less than a year is a relatively miniscule timeline for aerospace development.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I tell the (AstroForge) team all the time — if you’re not scared when we launch, we went too f**king slow,” Gialich added. “Like, you have to live on the edge of fear to achieve greatness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In many ways, AstroForge is a poster child for a dominant theme in the space industry. Young, ambitious startups are seeking to achieve what governments alone have done so far — and do it far more cheaply in the process. But with asteroid mining, no company has yet accomplished what Gialich and his team are about to attempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s going to be very, very hard’\n",
      "Odin, named for the father of Thor in Norse mythology, will be one of the first spacecraft developed by a private sector company to travel to deep space, or beyond the moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spacecraft is set to spend a little under a year traveling to an asteroid called 2022 OB5, which next year is expected to travel within about 403,000 miles (649,000 kilometers) of Earth. Equipped with an optical camera, Odin will snap photographs and transmit them to the mission team.\n",
      "\n",
      "AstroForge is banking that 2022 OB5 is an M-type asteroid, potentially rich with platinum. And if Odin’s camera can confirm that the space rock contains the valuable metal, a future AstroForge mission may aim to extract, refine and ferry the material back to Earth — where platinum is costly and used in various industries including electronics, pharmaceuticals and petroleum refining.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan is audacious, Gialich acknowledged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two other aerospace companies, Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries, folded while chasing such a dream in the past six years.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, only government space agencies from the United States and Japan have brought minuscule samples from asteroids back to Earth at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. To realize its vision, AstroForge will have to do this orders of magnitude cheaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission cost over $770 million for spacecraft development and assembly of its launch vehicle and returned just 122 grams of an asteroid sample in September 2023 — which was double the amount of material NASA hoped to collect.\n",
      "\n",
      "AstroForge says this flyby reconnaissance mission will cost the company less than $7 million. In total, the company has raised about $60 million to date — which just a decade ago would not even be enough money to get a tiny satellite to orbit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s going to be very, very hard for this company to be successful,” Gialich said. “I work every day at making it a little bit easier — and that’s all I can do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The vision\n",
      "But Gialich believes wholeheartedly in this pursuit, beyond just the mission at hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told CNN in an interview last year that he’s only partly motivated by the prospect of success. “Even if we’re not successful and we fail as a company, I hope that we push this forward a little bit,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The underlying mission, Gialich added, is to encourage the private sector to continue striving for outlandish feats in the hopes that the price of space travel continues to go down. Even if asteroid mining isn’t possible today, or done by AstroForge, it may become reality for one entity or another down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To me, it is about pushing humans forward,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gialich is not alone. Space visionaries have long imagined that precious metals could be abundantly harvested from the rocks flying aimlessly through our solar system — providing nearly bottomless access to resources that can be rare and environmentally destructive to obtain on our home planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the February 26 launch, as Odin takes off on board a lunar lander developed by Intuitive Machines, AstroForge will have perhaps made it further than any other startup founded under the same goal. While Planetary Resources launched a couple small demonstration satellites, AstroForge will be the first private-sector company to actually send a spacecraft in close proximity to an asteroid, venturing into deep space.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are plenty of upsides to the pursuit of asteroid mining, said Paul Stimers, an attorney and space policy expert with Holland & Knight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“From my perspective, all we’re doing is removing a rock from space, or hollowing out a rock in space, that doesn’t have any life on it, doesn’t have any ecology at all, doesn’t have any indigenous peoples,” Stimers told CNN. “There’s none of the things that have been downsides of terrestrial mining.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A legal framework\n",
      "There are, however, some key questions hanging over the prospect of mining asteroids for resources: Will it ever be cost-effective? What happens if more than one company targets the same asteroid? Is any of this legal in the first place?\n",
      "\n",
      "That last question was not specifically addressed in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which is the primary document governing global activity in space. The document does make the vague yet sweeping declaration that space is “the province of all mankind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And until recently, Stimers said it hardly mattered whether it was technically feasible for a company to mine an asteroid.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The question was, would they be allowed to keep what they mined?” Stimers said.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least for the United States, that question was answered with the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015, which Stimers had a hand in crafting, he said. The law made clear that private companies can, in fact, claim ownership of spaceborne materials, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only three other countries have similar laws: Japan, Luxembourg and the United Arab Emirates.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not without controversy\n",
      "AstroForge has already butted heads with the science community. That’s because the company initially declined to publicly say which asteroid it would target, leaving open the possibility that observatories could unwittingly spot the spacecraft and mistake it for something hazardous or a phenomenon worthy of additional inspection.\n",
      "\n",
      "AstroForge relented after pushback, acknowledging in January that it aimed to send the vehicle to 2022 OB5.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Gialich told CNN that things could change. “One of the best things we have as a company is we can change targets at any time … so it’s not a huge deal to me to say this one,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, when we find this mythical asteroid that’s purely platinum and is worth $1 trillion in actual material — am I going to tell the world which one it is?” Gialich said. “Probably not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Astronomers recognize that companies like AstroForge do not legally have to disclose where they are going in space. But it can cause costly and time-consuming headaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What we’d like to do is work in cooperation with (these) commercial entities to be able to make sure that science isn’t impacted in some of the most egregious ways,” the president of the American Astronomical Society, Dara Norman, told CNN earlier this month. “If we’re confused about whether something is an unknown asteroid … then it starts to cost us money to do things like tracking it or figuring it out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Inspiring and expensive\n",
      "Still, Gialich said he is not anti-science. The opposite is true, he stressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s inspired by bold, deep-space projects, such as NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, Voyager and Cassini. But he’s frustrated at the price points of such missions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t need to spend a billion and a half dollars to go answer some of the fundamental questions of the universe,” Gialich said. “We can do it for a lot less.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That is, at least, the hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not clear whether AstroForge’s $7 million Odin spacecraft will make it to the asteroid 2022 OB5.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s also unclear if the company will be able to determine — with any level of certainty — that the asteroid contains platinum based on the pictures Odin delivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "And even if it does, a future mission that travels back to 2022 OB5, or any other asteroid, and actually harvests resources for AstroForge to sell back on Earth is an even longer shot.\n",

      "Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have spied dynamic flares of light near the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The constant, rapid-fire display includes seconds-long short flashes and longer, blindingly bright flares of light on a daily basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Webb observations mark the longest, most detailed look researchers have been able to make around the Milky Way’s central black hole, called Sagittarius A*, building on past evidence of its highly energetic activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "While black holes are invisible, the flares unleashed by the swirling disk of hot gas and dust, or accretion disk, that orbits Sagittarius A* resemble a pyrotechnic extravaganza. A study describing the findings was published Tuesday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Astronomers believe the flares are coming from the inner edge of the accretion disk just beyond the black hole’s event horizon, or the area around a black hole where the pull of gravity is so strong that not even light can escape, according to NASA.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In our data, we saw constantly changing, bubbling brightness,” said lead study author Farhad Yusef-Zadeh, a professor of physics and astronomy at Northwestern University’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, in a statement. “And then boom! A big burst of brightness suddenly popped up. Then, it calmed down again. We couldn’t find a pattern in this activity. It appears to be random. The activity profile of this black hole was new and exciting every time that we looked at it.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Watching celestial fireworks\n",
      "The strong, gravitational influence of black holes pulls in gas and dust from any celestial object that wanders too close. The gas and dust swirl together at high speeds, forming the accretion disk that feeds the black hole. The rapid movement of the material causes it to heat up, releasing energy in the form of radiation as well as jets of material that don’t make it into the black hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "The radiation and jets can change the way gas is distributed throughout galaxies and feed the formation of stars, which is why supermassive black holes are regarded as giant engines at the centers of galaxies.\n",

      "Yusef-Zadeh and his colleagues observed Sagittarius A*, also called Sgr A*, for 48 hours over the course of one year in eight to 10-hour increments, using Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera to track the black hole’s activity. The team spied five to six big flares a day as well as smaller flashes of light in between.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Flares are expected to happen in essentially all supermassive black holes, but our black hole is unique,” Yusef-Zadeh said. “It is always bubbling with activity and never seems to reach a steady state. We observed the black hole multiple times throughout 2023 and 2024, and we noticed changes in every observation. We saw something different each time, which is really remarkable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The variability of the black hole’s activity is likely due to the random nature of the material flowing into the accretion disk, Yusef-Zadeh said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team believes the short bursts of light are created by minor, turbulent fluctuations within the accretion disk that could squeeze hot, energetic gas called plasma and cause a flash of radiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s similar to how the Sun’s magnetic field gathers together, compresses, and then erupts a solar flare,” Yusef-Zadeh said in a statement. “Of course, the processes are more dramatic because the environment around a black hole is much more energetic and much more extreme.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the longer, bigger flares may occur due to magnetic reconnection events, or when two different magnetic fields collide near the black hole and release energetic particles moving near the speed of light.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A magnetic reconnection event is like a spark of static electricity, which, in a sense, also is an ‘electric reconnection,’” Yusef-Zadeh said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A ‘rainbow’ of activity\n",
      "Webb’s capabilities enabled the team to observe the black hole’s flaring across two different wavelengths of light simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“(It was like) seeing the world in color versus in black and white, and (we) found rainbows,” Yusef-Zadeh said. “This tells you about the nature of flaring activity and the physical characteristics of the radiation mechanism, the magnetic field and the density of flares more directly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The observations provide a deeper look at how the black hole’s activity varies in brightness over time, said Tuan Do, associate professor in the physics and astronomy department and deputy director of the Galactic Center Group at UCLA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do was not involved in this study but has led research on Sagittarius A* in the past, including when the black hole showcased unusual activity in 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sgr A* got about half as bright in the new data as was seen in 2019, so I think that 2019 is still unusually active for the black hole,” Do said. “The black hole and its environment (are) always changing though so we are never sure what we’ll find! This is what makes observations of the galactic center so exciting, even though we’ve stared at this spot in the sky for decades now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the authors of the latest study observed the two different wavelengths of light from the black hole simultaneously, they realized the shorter wavelength changed in brightness just before the longer wavelength. The observation suggested that as the particles spiral around magnetic field lines, they lose energy more quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The changes in brightness have been noted in previous research and recent complementary data from the Mid-Infrared Instrument on the Webb telescope and other observatories.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think the next big step would be to try to connect these different data sources together to form a fuller picture of the physics of the environment around the supermassive black hole,” Do said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new study also confirms the black hole has “non-stop variability,” as previously observed, said Mark Morris, distinguished research professor in the department of physics and astronomy at UCLA. Morris was not involved in the new study.\n",
      "\n",
      "“X-ray astronomers see reasonably strong evidence that in the last few hundred years, there has been at least one, maybe two instances of enormous flares taking place,” Morris said via email, “with intensities (10,000 to 100,000) times larger than anything we’ve seen in the last quarter century that we have been closely examining Sgr A*.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What might have caused these flares? Astronomers still don’t know, but it’s possible the black hole gobbled up a planet a few hundred years ago, Morris said.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sun releases solar storms, scientists worry because such activity can potentially affect GPS, communications and the power grid on Earth. But at 25,000 light-years away, the highly energetic and variable activity of the Milky Way’s central black hole isn’t a concern, Morris said.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the Webb telescope observations allow researchers to understand what kind of “storms” are created when matter is compressed and heated as it is drawn toward the black hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beyond pure interest in the most dazzling fireworks that the universe can produce, those fireworks can have a profound effect on the evolution of the galaxies that they are in,” Morris said. “They can provoke or impede star formation on large scales, they can remove gas and clear out galaxies, leaving them unable to form stars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A longer look\n",
      "The study authors don’t believe the black hole was experiencing an unusual spike in activity, but they want to observe Sagittarius A* for an uninterrupted 24 hours to be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We also can see if these flares show periodicity (or repeat themselves) or if they are truly random,” Yusef-Zadeh said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Astronomers still don’t know how fast Sagittarius A* is spinning as it gobbles up matter, but longer observations could provide the data necessary to find the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, more data from Webb observations of Sagittarius A* could help astronomers simulate how accretion disks behave around black holes, as well as comparing the behaviors of less energetically active, black holes with more active ones.\n",

      " — \n",
      "Mars may have once hosted an ocean with waves that lapped against sandy beaches 3.6 billion years ago, according to new research. China’s Zhurong rover and its ground-penetrating radar detected the ancient shorelines when it operated from May 2021 to May 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rover landed in Utopia Planitia, a plain within the largest known impact basin on Mars, near a series of ridges in the planet’s northern hemisphere. Scientists have long questioned whether the ridges might represent the remnants of a shoreline, so Zhurong set out in search of evidence of ancient water.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study, based on data collected by Zhurong as its radar instrument peered beneath the surface to examine hidden rock layers, was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re finding places on Mars that used to look like ancient beaches and ancient river deltas,” said study coauthor Benjamin Cardenas, assistant professor of geology in the department of geosciences at Penn State, in a statement. “We found evidence for wind, waves, no shortage of sand — a proper, vacation-style beach.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s more, it’s possible the Martian environment was warmer and wetter for tens of millions of years longer than previously suspected, the study authors wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "The revelations add to the increasing evidence that the red planet once had a warmer, wetter climate as well as an ocean that covered one-third of the Martian surface — conditions that might have created a hospitable environment for life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The search for Mars’ ancient ocean\n",
      "In the 1970s, NASA’s Mariner 9 and Viking 2 were the first missions to spy features that suggested the presence of an ancient ocean on Mars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Utopia Planitia dates to the Hesperian Period, or 3.7 billion to 3 billion years ago, and it lacks abundant evidence for standing water, unlike more ancient regions of Mars, said Aaron Cavosie, a planetary scientist and senior lecturer at the Space Science and Technology Centre at Curtin University in Perth, Australia. Cavosie was not involved in the new study.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Mariner 9 orbiter first imaged giant canyons on Hesperian surfaces of Mars in the 1970s, but they are generally viewed as representing catastrophic bursts of groundwater to the surface, rather than evidence for standing water,” Cavosie said. “The idea is that Mars’ climate cooled down by this time and the surface dried up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple spacecraft have captured observations that suggest much of Mars’ water escaped to space as the planet’s atmosphere disappeared — astronomers are still investigating what caused this dramatic transformation. As the planet cooled, some of the water likely moved underground in the form of ice or combined with rocks to create minerals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Viking’s images showcased what appeared to be a shoreline in the northern hemisphere. But in stark contrast to the level shorelines on Earth, the Martian feature was jaggedly irregular, with height differences of up to 6.2 miles (10 kilometers).\n",
      "\n",
      "Study coauthor Michael Manga, a professor of Earth and planetary science at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues previously suggested that volcanic activity in the region, as well as a change in Mars’ rotation, altered the shoreline and caused it to be uneven over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because the spin axis of Mars has changed, the shape of Mars has changed. And so what used to be flat is no longer flat,” Manga said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what scientists needed most to answer their questions were observations made from “boots on the ground,” or in this case, rover tracks, Cavosie said. Zhurong would be able to see whether the rock layers buried in Utopia Planitia were volcanic or if they contained sediments consistent with those of an ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The dip of a shoreline\n",
      "When Zhurong landed, it traveled along Utopia Planitia’s ridges, collecting data up to 260 feet (80 meters) beneath the surface with radar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between 32.8 and 114.8 feet (10 and 35 meters) down, the rover’s radar detected sedimentary structures similar to layered beaches on Earth that dipped at a 14.5-degree angle. The radar also measured the size of the particles, which matched that of sand grains.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The structures don’t look like sand dunes,” Manga said. “They don’t look like an impact crater. They don’t look like lava flows. That’s when we started thinking about oceans. The orientation of these features (is) parallel to what the old shoreline would have been.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The structures strongly resembled coastal sediment deposits on Earth, such as those found in the Bay of Bengal, formed by the presence of a long-term stable ocean, the study authors said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team said it believes the rover found “foreshore deposits,” which take millions of years to form as sediments carried by tides and waves slope downward toward an ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This stood out to us immediately because it suggests there were waves, which means there was a dynamic interface of air and water,” Cardenas said. “When we look back at where the earliest life on Earth developed, it was in the interaction between oceans and land, so this is painting a picture of ancient habitable environments, capable of harboring conditions friendly toward microbial life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rivers likely helped dump sediment into the oceans, which was then distributed by waves to create beaches. Sedimentary rocks, carved channels and even the remains of an ancient river delta, studied by NASA’s Perseverance rover, have shown how water once shaped the Martian landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the ocean dried up, the beaches were likely blanketed by volcanic eruptions and material from dust storms, effectively preserving the shoreline, Cardenas said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s always a challenge to know how the last 3.5 billion years of erosion on Mars might have altered or completely erased evidence of an ocean,” he said. “But not with these deposits. This is a very unique dataset.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the team wants to determine the height of the waves and tides within the ocean, how long the ocean persisted, and whether it provided a potentially hospitable environment, Magna said.\n",
      "\n",
      "François Forget, senior research scientist and research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, said he isn’t entirely convinced by the hypothesis presented in the study that only ocean shorelines can explain the radar data. Forget was not involved in the new research.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not think that we can be certain that the observations could not be explained by dune processes,” or the formation of sand dunes, which Forget said he believes to be more likely on Mars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Dr. Joe McNeil, a planetary scientist and postdoctoral researcher at London’s Natural History Museum, believes the findings add weight to the hypothesis of an ancient northern ocean on Mars by providing crucial subsurface evidence. McNeil was not involved in the new study.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If these coastal deposits truly represent deposition of sediments at the edge of an ancient ocean, it suggests a prolonged period of stable liquid water, which has major implications for Mars’ climate history,” McNeil said. “It would mean Mars had conditions that could have supported a hydrological system with potential habitable environments for substantial amounts of time.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The rocket took off from California on February 1, hauling a batch of satellites for SpaceX’s Starlink network, which beams internet connectivity from space. But while the primary mission to deliver satellites to space went well, the rocket’s upper stage — or the portion that lights up after reaching space to finish off a mission — did not complete a controlled splashdown in the middle of the ocean as is typical, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.\n",
      "\n",

      "This is because the Games originated as an amateur competition intended to champion athletic success and the spirit of sports.\n",

      "Instead, the IOC spreads its money far and wide to further help the development of sport and its athletes.\n",

      "“The IOC redistributes 90% of all its income, in particular to the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and International Federations (IFs),” the IOC said in a statement sent to CNN.\n",

      "\n",
      "However, there are more direct methods for athletes to earn money via their success at the Games.\n",

      "World Athletics (WA) revealed that gold medalists in track events at Paris 2024 will receive prize money, becoming the first international sports governing body to do so.\n",

      "The announcement received a mixed response. The Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) said it had “several concerns” about the move, arguing that the introduction of prize money “undermines the values of Olympism and the uniqueness of the Games.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One cannot and should not put a price on an Olympic gold medal and, in many cases, Olympic medalists indirectly benefit from commercial endorsements,” it said in a statement. “This disregards the less privileged athletes lower down the final standings.”\n",

      "Athletes can also earn prize money through other means.\n",

      "At a press conference in May, IOC president Thomas Bach explained that it is “common practice” for athletes to receive prize money from NOCs, governmental bodies or through sponsors for their achievements at the Olympic Games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bach recalled his own memories of this process, recounting how he and his teammates received prize money from the German NOC for the fencing gold medal they won at the 1976 Games.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, US athletes received a total of $5.6 million in payments for medal performances through “Operation Gold.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "With the IOC focused on distributing its funding to further the development of sports around the world, Bach said it falls upon the NOCs and IFs – who he claimed are the primary beneficiaries of the “commercial success of the Games” – to choose how they incentivize their athletes and provide the best conditions for their delegations to perform in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The NOCs, they should use this money to provide to the Olympic Games the best athletes in their national delegation and to support them so that they can compete at the highest possible level in the Games,” Bach said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And they do so and then many of them reward the athletes with prize money for winning medals or diplomas or whatever. And this is absolutely in line and fine and common practice for decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bach continued: “The role of the IFs, according to this common understanding, is that they have to make every effort to try at least to close the gap between athletes coming from privileged countries or NOCs and from less privileged countries or NOCs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are, in this way, part of the solidarity effort of the IOC to do everything to create, in the best possible way, equal conditions for all athletes around the world and to help them to develop and to help them to have good coaches, good training conditions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, according to Conrad, the process of receiving money through sponsorships is weighted heavily in favor of the superstar athletes, with many of the lesser-known Olympic participants forced to spend their own money to fund their way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Getting those endorsements is not easy. I mean, you really have to be Simone Biles level or Sha’Carri Richardson level to get significant endorsement money,” Conrad explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, Biles earns $7 million from endorsements, according to Forbes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What sometimes companies will do, and it really depends on the level one is in, their endorsement deal will be free equipment and a few promotional events, but not a lot of money. And chances are it’s going to be the Olympic champions who will then get an endorsement for a lot of money.”\n",

      "A small space rock that lingered near Earth last year and was referred to as its temporary “mini-moon” may actually be a chunk of the moon that chipped off thousands of years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "The celestial near-Earth object, known as 2024 PT5, measures about 33 feet (10 meters) wide; however, it’s not in any danger of colliding with Earth now or over the next few decades due to its trajectory, according to researchers. After its close approach to the Earth, 2024 PT5 is slowly receding away in its new, more distant orbit.\n",
      "\n",
      "But surprisingly, the object’s orbit around the sun is similar to Earth’s, suggesting that 2024 PT5 originated from our corner of the solar system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Astronomers first spotted the asteroid on August 7 using the South Africa-based observatory of the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, or ATLAS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite predictions that the asteroid might become a temporary mini-moon whirling around Earth, the space rock maintained a horseshoe orbit that brought it close, but it never actually entered into an orbit around our planet. However, this almost-mini-moon is still special as it is potentially a piece of the real moon, said Dr. Teddy Kareta, a postdoctoral associate at Lowell Observatory in Arizona.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kareta is the lead author of a study about the object that was published January 14 in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was never really in orbit, but the vocabulary here to describe what it did do — approach the Earth from the inside, have its orbit slightly altered by a very close approach with the Earth-Moon system, and then recede away from us on the ‘outside’ in an overall horseshoe trajectory — hardly caters to fun nicknames,” Kareta said in an email. “It was nearly orbiting us for about two months. This kind of orbit is fundamentally rare, so it shouldn’t be too surprising that we don’t have a generic term for it yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kareta and his colleagues observed the object with the Lowell Discovery Telescope and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility at the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii. As sunlight reflected off 2024 PT5’s surface, the team realized it looked very similar to rocks retrieved from the lunar surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We had a general idea that this asteroid may have come from the Moon, but the smoking gun was when we found out that it was rich in silicate minerals — not the kind that are seen on asteroids but those that have been found in lunar rock samples,” Kareta said. “It looks like it hasn’t been in space for very long, maybe just a few thousand years or so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The discovery sheds light on a rare but growing population of lunar asteroids, which could reveal just how many times impacts on the moon have sent wayward space rocks flying into the vicinity of Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruling out space debris\n",
      "Kareta and members of his team at Lowell Observatory, who study near-Earth asteroids on close orbits, were already observing the object before anyone dubbed it a potential mini-moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure that 2024 PT5 wasn’t a hunk of space debris, like an old rocket, which can also be found in an Earthlike orbit, the team studied how the object moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Space rocks and manufactured items respond differently to solar radiation pressure, or the momentum of particles of light from the sun. These quantum particles, called photons, exert a tiny bit of force when they encounter objects in space. When many photons hit an object, they can speed it up or slow it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "When photons impact a hollow rocket booster, it moves like an empty tin can getting hit with a wind gust, while an asteroid’s motion won’t be very noticeably affected, according to NASA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists from NASA’s Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), which tracks asteroids and space debris, calculated the motion of 2024 PT5 and determined it was truly a space rock, rather than debris.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Space debris and space rocks move slightly differently in space,” said study coauthor Oscar Fuentes-Muñoz, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who worked with CNEOS researchers, in a statement. “Human-made debris is usually relatively light and gets pushed around by the pressure of sunlight. That 2024 PT5 doesn’t move this way indicates it is much denser than space debris.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Robert Jedicke, a specialist emeritus on solar system bodies at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy, believes the argument that 2024 PT5 is of lunar origin is convincing because the study authors “have performed an exhaustive analysis of all reasonable options.” Jedicke was not involved in the new study.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The hypothesis that minimoons, or objects like 2024 PT5 on heliocentric orbits similar to Earth’s, could be chips off the moon is perfectly reasonable,” Jedicke said in an email. “It is expected that some objects launched off the moon by an asteroid or comet impact would evolve into these kinds of orbits.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple studies about the object have been published since its discovery in August, and a September paper by Carlos de la Fuente Marcos, a researcher on the faculty of mathematical sciences at the Complutense University of Madrid, was one of the first. He said that most research has arrived at a similar conclusion about 2024 PT5 being lunar debris. De la Fuente Marcos was not involved in the new study.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right after discovery, CNEOS’ director Paul Chodas stated that the dynamics of 2024 PT5 could only be explained if it was a fragment of the moon released during an impact event. His words have been prophetic,” de la Fuente Marcos said.\n",
      "\n",
      "De la Fuente Marcos’ paper in September suggested that the object is part of the Arjuna asteroid belt, which is made of small asteroids that have orbits around the sun similar to Earth’s orbit. The possibility that this belt is made of lunar debris is “indeed an unexpected discovery,” de la Fuente Marcos said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Classifying lunar asteroids\n",
      "Given the lack of weathering on the asteroid, it can only be a maximum of about a few million years old, Kareta said, but it’s likely much younger. The reflectivity of the asteroid’s surface best matches material from the Lunar Highlands, or the bright, rough terrain on most of the moon’s surface, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "If scientists can link lunar asteroids to specific craters on the moon, the space rocks could reveal more about material on the lunar surface, as well as below it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, 2024 PT5 is just the second object in an Earth-like orbit of purported lunar origin. Astronomers found asteroid 469219 Kamo’oalewa in 2016, which was also likely ejected from the lunar surface after something slammed into the moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discovery of Kamo’oalewa excited asteroid scientists who were eager to find more, but no other candidates have emerged until 2024 PT5.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If there’s one of something, it’s easy to convince yourself that it’s an outlier or hard to explain,” Kareta said. “If there are two, then there’s a whole population out there waiting to be recognized and studied.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kareta and his colleagues estimate that as many as 16 asteroids of lunar origin have already been found and await confirmation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The total size and properties of the population are directly related to how often the moon produces these little wayward rocks — that’s the kind of information we want to go after as this population grows,” Kareta said.\n",
      "\n",
      "More sensitive telescopes coming online in the future, like the Vera Rubin Observatory on Earth (in Chile) and the NEO Surveyor in space, will be able to detect more asteroids in general, including small, faint rocks ejected by the moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re also going to have to get savvier about how we can whittle down the dozens or hundreds of candidate objects with interestingly lunar-like orbits before we go out to the telescope,” Kareta said. “It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack, except the needles don’t look too different from the hay until you get them in front of a telescope.”\n",

      "The pool has been the scene of some of the Games’ most legendary moments over the years and 2024 appears set to be no different. Several key swimmers are looking to end up on the podium one last time in what could be their final Olympics, while others are looking to play spoiler.\n",

      "The 10-time medalist is aiming to cement her legacy as one of the greatest American swimmers of all time in Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ledecky started off her Olympics with bronze medal finish in Saturday’s 400-meter freestyle.\n",
      "\n",
      "She’ll also compete in the 800-meter and the 1,500-meter races over the next several days. She’s won gold in the 800 three times and gold in the 1,500 twice – and hasn’t been defeated in those races in any of the Olympics that she’s entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results in Tokyo suggested the rest of the world might be catching up to the American star, at least in the 800-meter, and Saturday’s swim confirmed those results.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the 400-meter is not Ledecky’s best race, she finished ahead of Ariarne Titmus in a semifinal heat. American hopes were raised as anticipation built in La Défense Arena.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the matchup wasn’t really much of a contest at all. Titmus ended Ledecky’s hopes of revenge, dominating the race and finishing almost a full second ahead of Canada’s Summer McIntosh, who took silver. Ledecky finished a distant third, about three seconds off the pace.\n",

      "Fallout from Chinese doping scandal\n",
      "Chinese swimmers are under an intense microscope in Paris, fairly or unfairly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since the New York Times reported in April that 23 Chinese swimmers had all tested positive for the same banned substance ahead of the Tokyo Olympics and were still allowed to compete at the games in 2021, resentment and frustration has been simmering in the water. Eleven of those Chinese swimmers are due to compete again in Paris, and many of their rivals are preparing to go against them with a sense of bitter resignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rob Koehler, director of international sports advocacy group Global Athlete, told CNN that they are already anticipating the worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If any of those 11 Chinese swimmers hit a podium,” he told CNN last week, “they will absolutely lose it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned performance enhancing drug Trimetazidine at a national meet several months before the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, but China’s Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) said that the concentration was “extremely low.” CHINADA decided that the swimmers were not responsible for the results because the drug had been accidentally ingested via some contaminated food.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was notified of the test results a month before the games in 2021 and accepted CHINADA’s conclusion, because, according to WADA’s President Witold Bańka, they found “no credible way to disprove the contamination theory that was accepted by CHINADA.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The US government is investigating the case and it’s likely that any Chinese swimmer who wins in Paris will be under scrutiny from the media, fans and their fellow swimmers as questions over whether the races are truly clean will swirl.\n",
      "\n",
      "American swimmer Caeleb Dressel told reporters last week that he didn’t feel like he’d competing on a level playing field.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, not really. I don’t think they’ve given us enough evidence to support them (World Aquatics) with how this case was handled,” Dressel said.\n",

      "Australian-American rivalry reignited\n",
      "The heat is turned up on the rivalry between two of the greatest swimming nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controversial comments in 2023 by Australian swimmer Cate Campbell – who won’t be in Paris after failing to qualify – were given new life by USA legend Michael Phelps in a viral video filmed by NBC last month. Phelps was reacting to a video from Campbell saying it was always sweeter to win when beating the USA.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s just so much sweeter beating America,” Campbell told an Australian news station.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When we’re like right next to each other in the warmup areas, the US have this like infernal cowbell that they ring. And as someone leaves to go out to the competition pool, they all go ‘U-S-A! U-S-A!’ and I’ve never wanted to punch someone more,” she added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phelps in the video said he would make a rival regret ever saying something like that to him if he was on the US team, naming dropping former rivals Ian Thorpe of Australia and Chad le Clos of South Africa as examples of people who tried to get in his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You guys have all talked s— about me and I had the last laugh. For the Americans, if you saw what I just saw … I would watch that thing every single day to give me that little extra bit of just oomph,” Phelps said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The back-and-forth will take on new life as Aussie and American swimmers take to the pool and compete to take home the most medals. Australia’s women topped the American women with eight gold medals in Tokyo and will be looking to repeat the feat this time around.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tone was set early on when Ledecky and Titmus faced off in the 400-meter freestyle and Titmus easily beat her American rival. In fact, the Australians medaled in all four medal races on Saturday night – two golds and two silvers – to the Americans’ three. But in the last race of the night, the American men’s 4X100 freestyle team took back the momentum by winning Team USA’s first gold of the Olympics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, despite Phelps’ urging, the competition is mostly friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronte Campbell, swimming on the Australian’s 4x100-meter freestyle relay team, told reporters: “I really respect our American competitors. I’ve known a lot of them for many years. I’ve enjoyed racing them, and I’m looking forward to doing it again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Leon Marchand carries French hopes in the pool\n",
      "Billed as a potential successor to Phelps, Marchand is likely to be one of the key figures for the host nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marchand, who broke Phelps’ last remaining world record in the 400-meter individual medley, will be swimming in four events in Paris. It’s likely the French team’s best hope for gold in the pool and will be cheered loudly by his supporters who long to hear “La Marseillaise” playing with him on the podium.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s been 12 years since the French have won a medal in swimming.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 22-year-old is the favorite in the 400-meter medley again this year and is also expected to compete closely in the 200-meter individual medley, 200-meter butterfly and 200-meter breaststroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Caeleb Dressel hopes to use fatherhood to spring him to glory\n",
      "Dressel – the top American male swimmer again at this Olympics – is using his experience as a new father to drive him forward in his slightly scaled-back Olympics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having already won seven gold medals in his Olympic career, Dressel will compete in fewer races in these Games. He’ll focus on the 100-meter butterfly, the 50-meter freestyle and has already won gold as a part of the 4x100-meter relay team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dressel has won gold in every Olympic event he’s entered so far in his career. It’s a sterling record that he’ll look to keep as he aims for double-digit gold medals over the course of his three Olympic Games.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told reporters last week that his son, August, is now his inspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t imagine my life before August was here, so yes, it’s very, very different. Pretty much all I have time for is him and swimming, but I don’t want to be doing anything else,” Dressel said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s extremely different with a whole new routine, a lot more challenges that come with it, earlier bedtimes for myself, more naps, so camp has been great to sleep in a little bit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After his win on Saturday, Dressel said doing it in front of his family made it all the sweeter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s really special, making the team in front of them and then winning the gold in front of them, just checking little boxes that I never would have thought to create throughout my career,” he told reporters. “So that was a really, really special event tonight.”\n",

      "For almost two weeks, the world has watched transfixed as athletes have pushed themselves to the limit at these Paris Olympic Games, ripping every imaginable emotion out themselves – their elation, joy, relief, shock, disappointment, despair, anxiety and excitement displayed for all to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is these emotions that define the Olympics, these moments of release after so many years of control and sacrifice. But soon when the athletes return home, all these emotions, these immense highs of competing at the Games or winning a medal can fade away into what has been dubbed “the post-Olympic blues” – a still relatively under-researched phenomenon that has been highlighted by the athletes themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It has similarities to anyone that has been doing something for a very long time,” the USA’s most decorated winter Olympian Apolo Ohno told CNN Sport. “They … felt like this is what they were made to do, they were good at it. And then at a snap of a finger, it’s no longer available and now they have to go and do something else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s next is the question often asked of athletes in press conferences after their races. What do you do after achieving your life’s work? What happens when you go home after suddenly becoming a household name? Where do you go after starring in the biggest show on earth? What do you do if you have to wait four more years to achieve your goals?\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as athletes bask in the glory of their achievements, returning to and readjusting to a different, normal life after an Olympic Games can be difficult. And as each returns to their own specific set of pressures, for some those “blues” can linger, take root and turn into periods of depression, even for those athletes who have won gold medals.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re on a high and you don’t really have a chance to understand what you did, for one. And you don’t really have a chance to come down and relax. It’s like you’re on this high and all of a sudden you go down that cliff,” Allison Schmitt, the American swimmer who won 10 Olympic medals – four of them gold – and has completed a masters degree in social work, told CNN Sport.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We may be looked at as superhuman on TV and we might feel superhuman when we’re winning gold medal after gold medal, but at some point, every high has a low and it’s okay to have that low but it’s not okay to isolate like I did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘When the rollercoaster hit’\n",
      "Schmitt radiated energy in the moments before the race that would change her life, biting her lip and bouncing up and down on the poolside, preparing herself for the minutes ahead. Already at that Olympics in London, she had won a bronze medal in the 4x100m freestyle relay and a silver in the 400m freestyle, matching her tally of medals from Beijing.\n",
      "\n",
      "To her left was Camille Muffat, the recently crowned 400m freestyle Olympic champion; to her right was Federica Pellegrini, the defending Olympic champion and world record holder. In less than two minutes – one minute and 53 seconds to be precise – Schmitt would beat them both, become an Olympic champion, set an Olympic record and achieve the goal for which she, as well as her family and friends, had sacrificed so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had dedicated her whole life to this goal, missed high school prom and graduation, put parts of her life “on hold,” redshirted and left her college in her senior year to move to a city where she knew no-one to “solely train.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, she produced a flawless performance, finishing the race with enough time to grab the lane divider and raise her hand to the sky in triumph before her competitors had even touched the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I remember one of the coaches saying to me after the 200 free … ‘You’re on cloud nine, do I need to pinch you?’ And I’m like, ‘No, let me live in this moment. Let me relish this feeling,’” Schmitt recalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the London Games passed in a golden blur for her as she picked up two more Olympic titles in the 4x200m freestyle relay and the 4x100m medley relay.\n",
      "\n",
      "“During that Olympics, I was on a complete high and it was coming back from it, that’s when the rollercoaster hit,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "She returned home to the USA as a recognizable face, someone whose exploits who had been beamed into millions of homes worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I left as Allison Schmitt and I came back as Allison Schmitt, the gold medalist, and there are people that just look at you not as a human and are kind of like, ‘Oh there’s a gold medalist, there’s that swimmer girl.’ It’s like, I can hear you, I’m still a human being and I can still hear you whispering about me. I can see your jaw drop and just stare at me,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re told so often when you come back from the Olympics how people wish they were you, how you’re so lucky … how they would do anything for these gold medals,” she adds. “And I don’t think they realize what it took to get those gold medals, all the sacrifices, all the hard work, all the taxing physically, mentally, emotionally you have on your body.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still being “grateful” and understanding the sacrifices that everyone around her had made proved to be a “huge hurdle” for Schmitt when asking for help. “I didn’t want it to seem like I was complaining because, ultimately, I was very grateful for this … but it was definitely a time where you don’t feel human because so many people are looking at you as an object,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Struggling to cope and feeling like she wasn’t her usual “happy-go-lucky, optimistic” self, Schmitt began to isolate herself as her mental health deteriorated and attempted to go to therapy but didn’t click with her first therapist and “not really understanding therapy” at that time didn’t try to find another one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I continued to isolate, it was like I’m just going to sleep because at least when I’m sleeping, I can’t feel this. And so I cried myself to sleep. It took until January 2015 when I was at my absolute lowest point when someone said to me, ‘Let’s get some help.’ I was like, ‘I guess I’m at a point where I want to end my life, I want to do all these things, I don’t know what else to do.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "She found another therapist who she clicked with and credits showing up for her teammates as well as swimming itself for saving her life. Then, her 17-year-old cousin took her own life in May 2015, prompting Schmitt to speak about her experiences in therapy when it was still stigmatized in the hope that it would help others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, she returned to the Olympics and won yet another gold medal at the 2016 Rio Games in the 4x200m freestyle relay and a silver in the 4x100m freestyle before continuing on to the Tokyo Games where she won a silver and bronze medal in those same events, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A trap that the mind can set’\n",
      "When Ohno won his first Olympic gold medal at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, he became the USA’s first male short track speed skating Olympic champion ever. He became the face of the sport in his home country for the next decade, winning eight Olympic medals – including two golds – before writing two books about his athletic career and his metamorphosis into an entrepreneur.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My life changed quite literally within a span of 24 hours,” he said, remembering winning his first Olympic gold medal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was no longer this kind of athlete who was relatively unknown… now, my name and my picture and my face was everywhere and I didn’t know how to respond to that. I didn’t know how to act. I don’t think there’s anything in the world that can prepare you for instant fame or instant recognizability.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As I grow older, I realize now that most of this probably was not true, but you start to believe in something: this is how the world believes I should be, this is how the world believes that I should act and respond, this is who the world thinks I should be with and all these things. It takes time to live authentically to yourself and also to the values that you want to uphold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is tempting to think that the stories that captivate the world during the Olympics end neatly sewn up when the Games conclude, that the athletes who accomplish superhuman feats ride off into the sunset.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s certainly a trap the mind, and to a certain extent the media, can set that if you win this medal then you will be bliss for ever after,” sports psychologist Peter Haberl, who worked with the USOPC for 18 years until 2023 and now works with the Indian women’s hockey team, told CNN Sport.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that’s not how life works. If we prepare the athlete properly, then it’s not just about reaching that peak, it’s also what comes after it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "More and more athletes, like Schmitt and Ohno, have spoken about the pressures of going for gold and the ways in which that pressure changes if they achieve that goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "British swimmer Adam Peaty, who has won three Olympic gold and three silver medals, told the BBC in May 2023 that a “a gold medal is the coldest thing you will ever wear … because you think it will fix all of your problems. It will not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took a break from the sport before returning to win a silver medal in Paris and has spoken about suffering from depression and problems with alcohol. “I took a break because I was on this endless search of a gold medal or a world record and I looked into the future and I said ‘OK, if I do get that, is my life fixed or any better?’ No,” Peaty told the BBC.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2020, Michael Phelps produced and narrated an HBO documentary, “The Weight of Gold,” detailing these pressures and criticizing the lack of governing bodies’ support for them. “Really, after every Olympics, I think I fell into a major state of depression,” he said in 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, Simone Biles withdrew from several events at the Tokyo Olympics suffering from the “twisties,” a mental block causing gymnasts to lose track of themselves in the air. On her return to the sport, she has both consolidated her status as the greatest gymnast of all time and changed conversations around mental health both inside and outside sport.\n",
      "\n",
      "As athletes have advocated for themselves and detailed the pressures before, during and after an Olympic Games, there has been some response from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and national federations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The athletes are people first and their whole holistic wellbeing should be taken care of,” Kirsty Burrows – the head of the safe sport unit at the IOC – tells CNN Sport. “In the run up to the Olympic Games, there’s clearly a huge focus on their athletic identity … and it’s trying to balance this and make sure that after the Olympics, some athletes can struggle with … this athletic and their non-athletic identity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a helpline for athletes, available in over 70 languages both during and after the Games, more than 165 athlete welfare officers trained in safeguarding or as mental health professionals and a “mind zone” above the gym in the Olympic Village for the first time ever, where athlete can complete mindfulness exercises, contribute to a positivity wall or spend time in a disconnection pod, Burrows said.\n",
      "\n",
      "She adds that there are courses available that detail “psychologically recovering from big events” as well as a program that helps retiring athletes transition into a non-athletic career.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Haberl as a sports psychologist, he said his role is to prepare “the athlete to lead a rich and meaningful life,” to encourage them to “separate and differentiate goals from values,” and help them see that the attention around the Games is an “illusion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Everything seems to matter’\n",
      "For almost every sport included in the program, the Olympic Games represents the biggest prize available and their one shot at mainstream exposure, heightening the stakes around winning a medal, or competing there. The pressure to perform is different compared to other professional sports that have popular competitions annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most Olympic athletes are competing in arenas that are normally pretty empty,” Ohno says. “And there’s not a lot of prize money. There’s no salary, depending on which sport it is, obviously in skiing, swimming and in gymnastics, there’s some great sponsor dollars, but think about all the sports that are non-traditional. There’s just no real market for that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The pressure is almost unimaginable, the margins between victory and defeat wafer thin. Neither Noah Lyles nor Kishane Thompson knew who had won the men’s 100 meters final in Paris on Sunday until a photo finish showed Lyles’ torso millimeters ahead of Thompson on the line; just 12 tenths of a second separated the eight men in the final. In Ohno’s own sport of short track speed skating, anything can go wrong in the jostling for position and the tiny margins of victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We know that when I go to the Olympic Games and I may miss the actual podium by two finger snaps just like that, all of a sudden the training today, four years away from the Games seems to really matter,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s why we see this incredible obsessiveness around the training and the consistency in the pattern and routine from athletes … because we know the margins are so slim … and we feel like every single thing that goes into our training, our mental preparation, our recovery, our sleep, the food, the equipment, everything seems to matter.”\n",

      " — \n",
      "Researchers have detected organic compounds and minerals necessary for life in unprecedented samples collected from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, adding evidence to the idea that asteroids likely delivered the building blocks of life to our planet early in its history.\n",
      "\n",
      "The samples are also providing a window into understanding what kind of chemical and biological processes were already underway as space rocks chaotically ricocheted around during the early days of the solar system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preliminary analyses of the rock and dust samples released within the past year have shown that the asteroid contained water as well as carbon, nitrogen and other organic matter, but the chemical composition of the organic material was largely unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, new research has revealed the asteroid contains many of the chemical building blocks of life, such as amino acids and components found in DNA, said Dr. Daniel P. Glavin, senior scientist for samples return at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is all very exciting because it suggests that asteroids like Bennu once acted like giant chemical factories in space and could have also delivered the raw ingredients for life to Earth and other bodies in our solar system,” said Glavin, lead author of a study on the samples published Wednesday in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the authors of a separate paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature uncovered salts and minerals crucial to life, including some never seen in asteroid samples before, within Bennu’s rocks — as well as highlighting the role that ancient water played on the asteroid.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of both papers, shared Wednesday during a NASA press conference, present a “groundbreaking scientific discovery,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These two papers together go hand in hand to say that Bennu was a much more interesting and complicated place than we probably gave it credit for even six months ago,” said Dr. Tim McCoy, co-lead author of the Nature study and curator of meteorites at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Up close with extraterrestrial biology\n",
      "Bennu is a carbon-rich space rock known as a rubble pile asteroid. Scientists believe Bennu was once part of a larger “parent” asteroid that lost a few pieces due to an impact. Then, those blasted-off pieces coalesced, like a pile of rocky rubble that is weakly held together by gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sample was collected from Bennu in October 2020 by a NASA mission called OSIRIS-REx, or Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer. It marked the first time the US sent a spacecraft to briefly land on an asteroid and collect material. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft then dropped off a capsule when it swung by Earth in September 2023, sending it parachuting down into the Utah desert.\n",
      "\n",
      "A team of researchers worked to carefully retrieve the capsule and ensure that the samples inside remained pristine and completely sealed against any of Earth’s atmosphere and environment that could contaminate the extraterrestrial rocks and dust and potentially skew any analysis of its properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists were thrilled when they realized that the capsule contained double the expected cache of material, which amounted to about 120 grams, or about the weight of a bar of soap. Samples were divided up and shared with researchers around the globe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glavin and his team detected thousands of organic molecular compounds, including 33 amino acids, in the Bennu samples they studied. Amino acids, or molecules that combine to form proteins, are some of the building blocks of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers found 14 of the 20 amino acids that are used in biology to build proteins, and 19 non-protein amino acids, many of which are rare or nonexistent in known biology, Glavin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team also detected adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine and uracil — all five of the biological nucleobases, or components that make up the genetic code in DNA and RNA.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These organic molecules have all been found previously in meteorites, but in contrast to meteorites, the Bennu samples are pristine and were protected from heating during atmospheric entry and exposure to terrestrial contamination,” Glavin said. “So we have a much higher confidence now that these chemical building blocks of life are in fact extraterrestrial in origin and formed in space, and are not contaminants from Earth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Glavin’s team also found compounds rich in nitrogen and ammonia in the samples, suggesting that Bennu was part of a larger asteroid that formed about 4.5 billion years ago in the frigid, distant regions of the solar system. Ammonia is essential for many biological processes, Glavin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ammonia ice is more stable the farther it is from a heat source, like the sun. The researchers believe that the ammonia-enriched ice melted inside the large parent asteroid body, estimated to be bigger than 62 miles (100 kilometers) in diameter, creating a liquid environment inside the rock that allowed complex organic molecules, such as the amino acids and nucleobases, to form.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Having studied meteorites for 35 years, these record the first half billion years of our solar system history that were wiped out by plate tectonics and volcanism and the water cycle here on Earth,” McCoy said. “I thought we were going to learn about the earliest geologic history of our solar system. What we ended up finding was a lot of information about the earliest biologic history of our solar system, which is remarkable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A ‘soup of the elements’\n",
      "McCoy’s team, including 66 researchers across four continents, found the salt and minerals left behind as water on Bennu, or its larger parent asteroid, evaporated. The minerals include sodium phosphates, carbonates, sulfates, chlorides and fluorides, some of which are necessary to the formation of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team was surprised to find the mineral trona, also known as sodium carbonate or soda ash, which has never been directly observed in another asteroid or meteorite. On Earth, it is used in cleaning products and glass manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers believe that pockets or veins of water flowed beneath the surface of Bennu’s parent asteroid, which was probably similar to a big ball of mud in the early days of the solar system, McCoy said. Cracks and fractures in the asteroid allowed water to evaporate to the surface, leaving behind a concentrated brine, or a “soup of the elements,” in its wake.\n",
      "\n",
      "This concentrated brine, similar to the salty crusts of dry lakebeds on Earth, is where salts and minerals could mingle and create more complex structures, setting the stage for organic compounds to form.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We now know from Bennu that the raw ingredients of life were combining in really interesting and complex ways on Bennu’s parent body,” McCoy said. “We have discovered that next step on a pathway to life. But we don’t know how far along that pathway this environment could allow things to progress.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brines are of interest to planetary scientists because they could be environments that support the formation of life. It’s also possible that they exist on other worlds in our solar system, including ocean worlds such as Saturn’s icy moon Enceladus — which also contains sodium carbonate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Delivering the potential for life\n",
      "The presence of water, minerals, salts and amino acids suggests it was possible for the building blocks of life to come together in interesting ways on Bennu, but Glavin said more research is required to determine how organic compounds formed and evolved on the space rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the minerals have small bits of water trapped in their crystalline structures, so researchers may be able to learn about how the composition of the brine changed over time, which could provide clarity about what took place in the evaporating water, McCoy said.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the mysteries presented by the samples is a mixture of amino acids.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amino acids have handedness, meaning they can be created in two mirror-image versions, like a pair of hands. On Earth, life produces left-handed amino acids, so Glavin expected to see that reflected in the Bennu samples — but it contains an equal mixture of both, suggesting that amino acids likely began on Earth as both. Now, Glavin and his colleagues wonder why life on Earth “turned left” rather than right.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of material found in the samples suggests chemical building blocks of life were widespread throughout the solar system, providing strong evidence that the asteroids bombarding early Earth may have delivered water and organic material to its surface, Glavin noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that theory raises the question of whether this life-delivering bombardment ever successfully occurred on any other planet in the solar system, McCoy said. And there is also the puzzle of why life didn’t form inside Bennu itself, given that most of the raw ingredients needed were present, Glavin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe it was because there just wasn’t enough time to do the more complex organic chemistry need for life before the salty liquids evaporated in the parent body,” Glavin said. “Future missions to other bodies in our solar system will be critical to seek the answers about how life began on Earth and our search for life elsewhere.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“I thought I had more time,” Hall said. “I saw the fire charging down the hill and knew that I had to get out of there. I opened up the back of my SUV, I loaded a painting, one other object.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the time I was going back in from that run, hot embers were raining down from the sky. I knew at that point that I just didn’t have much time. I could see the embers hitting the roofs of the houses around me and made that decision: it’s time to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The medals were in a closet in my bedroom, 70 feet away, and I didn’t have time to go get them. From the time that I saw the first plume of smoke at the top of the hill … I had about three minutes between then and when it came charging towards me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It wasn’t easy to leave that behind. I worked a lifetime to achieve that and the memories remain but the souvenir is gone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when he had driven to the bottom of the hill that he lives on, Hall said he quickly realized he still wasn’t in a safe area. He described people standing around filming the fires on the hills, “unaware of the impending danger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He made his way to the Palisades Village, arriving there before the fire did, but it quickly turned into chaos.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was one of the first hill evacuees to make it into the village,” Hall said. “There was one other car of a person that had fled in the parking lot, surrounded by five pre-schools, elementary schools, kindergartens and schools still in session and you could see it went from an idyllic, peaceful Palisades village, descending into mayhem and panic.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There were people screaming, cars driving up on the sidewalk. Imagine the desperation of a parent trying to get to their child in time to get them from the school and to safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you have cars blowing through stop signs, red lights, crashes happening and people running in every direction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hall, known for his speed and showmanship, represented the US in the 1996, 2000 and 2004 Olympics. He won 10 Olympic medals, including five gold medals. He also won three gold and three silver world championship medals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hall was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 1999. He is the son of Gary Hall Sr., who won medals at three Olympic Games.\n",
      "\n",
      "A GoFundMe page has been set up for the younger Hall, which says, “Gary Jr. lost his home and his livelihood in the devastating Palisades Fire on January 7th.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gary saw flames out his window while he was at home before collecting his dog, Puddles, his insulin, a painting of his grandfather, and a religious wooden piece his daughter Gigi gave him and drove towards the ocean as quickly as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was forced to leave behind everything else he owned, such as irreplaceable family heirlooms, photos, and more. He has also most likely lost his ten Olympic medals, but nothing can take away his spirit that won those medals.”\n",

      "While life-changing, the procedure allowed Woodhall to get fitted with prosthetic legs, defying some who said he would never be able to walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given his father was in the Air Force, Woodhall and his two older brothers were home-schooled at first, but his parents would always emphasize the importance of exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "It meant Woodhall spent his early years chasing after his brothers, trying his hand at various sports. It was, as he said, a “great environment to be raised in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But life became a little more difficult when Woodhall enrolled into public school in fifth-grade. It was there that he really recognized his differences, and initially struggled with bullying from other children.\n",
      "\n",
      "In search of somewhere to feel comfortable, he eventually found track and field. Unlike other sports where coaches would sometimes feel nervous about letting him play, athletics allowed Woodhall to express himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was just me versus the clock and I found peace in that. I found excitement in that. It’s just up to me to get a little bit better,” he said, admitting it took a while before his talent shone through.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I kind of fell in love with that process and it took me a while. From seventh grade all the way up until my sophomore year of high school, I was not impressive in any way on the track.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But just all those years of dedication and little changes, getting a little better every year, definitely added up. It got me to where I am now.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The Algerian – who is a cisgender woman who won gold in the women’s 66kg boxing competition – was the subject of global attention during the Olympics after defeating Italian boxer Angela Carini in just 46 seconds in a preliminary match. The fight triggered an onslaught of online abuse, with transphobic commentators incorrectly calling Khelif “a man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On Monday, the IBA said in a statement it would file “an official complaint with the Attorney General of Switzerland” against the Swiss-based IOC following the participation of Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting – who the IBA called “ineligible athletes in the 2024 Olympic boxing tournament in Paris.”\n",

In addition, similar complaints are to be filed with the Attorneys General of France and the USA.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the statement, the IBA did not explain what they meant when using the term “safety risk.”\n",

      "In response to the IBA’s legal action and statement, the gold medalist boxer posted a statement on Instagram on Tuesday, saying: “For eight years, I have fought for my dream – eight years of sacrifice, discipline, and perseverance to stand on the Olympic stage and represent my country with pride. I have earned my place, and I will continue to stand firm in the face of any challenge.\n",

      "“The International Boxing Association (IBA), an organization that I am no longer associated with and which is no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee, have again made baseless accusations that are false and offensive, using them to further their agenda. This is a matter that concerns not just me but the broader principles of fairness and due process in sport.\n",

      "“My team is carefully reviewing the situation and will take all necessary legal steps to ensure that my rights and the principles of fair competition are upheld. Those responsible for these actions must be held accountable, and we will pursue all available legal avenues to ensure that justice prevails. I am not going anywhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When reached by CNN on Thursday, the IOC said in a statement: “This IBA statement is just another example of IBA’s campaign against the IOC which is ongoing since their recognition was withdrawn by the IOC for issues related to governance, judging and refereeing as well as questions around their finances.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The two female athletes mentioned by IBA are not transgender athletes. They were born as women, were raised as women, and have competed in the women’s category for their entire boxing careers, including at previous international competitions such as the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, when both of them did not win a medal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They also competed in IBA World Championships and IBA-sanctioned tournaments before they became victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA. Towards the end of the IBA World Championships in 2023 they were disqualified, without any due process.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The IOC also pointed to mixed track records in the ring of both boxers before the 2024 Olympics, speaking to data indicating “neither athlete has more Referee Stop Contest (RSC) victories compared to other successful female boxers … such data is relevant when evaluating whether (they) had a heightened performance advantage and/or safety risk compared to other successful boxers in the women’s category.”\n",

      "“Jordan Chiles’ appeals present the international community with an easy legal question—will everyone stand by while an Olympic athlete who has done only the right thing is stripped of her medal because of fundamental unfairness in an ad-hoc arbitration process? The answer to that question should be no,” Maurice M. Suh, counsel for Chiles, said.\n",

      "February ends with a treat for sky-gazers: a parade of seven planets across the night sky, including Mercury, Uranus and Neptune alongside typically bright planets such as Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. But glimpsing all seven won’t be easy, astronomers say.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the seven planets will all be above the horizon just after sunset, Mercury and Saturn will be more difficult to spot Thursday and Friday evenings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mercury and Saturn are particularly close to the sun and will be lost in the sun’s glare, though Mercury will get higher and higher each day and easier to spot,” said Shannon Schmoll, director of the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University, in a statement.\n",
      "“To have a chance, you will need a clear view of the western horizon and maybe binoculars to spot them after the sun sets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Venus and Jupiter will be easier to spot thanks to their brightness, and Mars will stand out with its telltale reddish-orange hue, Schmoll said.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Neptune and Uranus are not typically visible to the naked eye and will likely require a telescope or binoculars to see, she said.\n",

      "\n",

      "How to spot the seven planets\n",
      "Saturn and Mercury are going to be “horizon huggers,” likely only visible in twilight or the illumination in the sky after the sun has dipped below the horizon, with Venus visible at the same time, said EarthSky editor Marcy Curran in a recent YouTube video.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uranus and Neptune, of course, are there, but you need optical aid to see them, and you’ll probably not catch Jupiter and Mars, which are higher in the sky, until at least darkness starts to fall,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Curran advised looking for Mercury and Saturn, which will be low on the western horizon, about 30 minutes after sunset, with the aid of binoculars.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The planets will be in the southern half of the sky,” said Emily Elizondo, a doctoral student of physics and astrophysics at Michigan State, in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Toward the southwest is where Saturn and Mercury are going to be, and then toward the southeast is where Mars and Jupiter will be, and then Neptune, Venus and Uranus will be in between. There are apps that use motion-sensing technology, so you can type in the planet’s name, and it’ll show you where that planet is in the sky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let Venus help\n",
      "Not sure where to look? When in doubt, look for Venus. It will be at its brightest, but the planet will be low in the western sky and dropping closer to the horizon each night before it disappears from the night sky by mid-March, said EarthSky contributor John Goss. Venus will reappear in the morning sky in April, according to NASA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike stars, which appear to twinkle, Venus will remain a steady bright light high above in the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "When evening twilight ends at 6:58 p.m. ET Friday, the Cheshire moon will appear, according to the space agency. Around this time of year, the celestial object has earned this name because the thin sliver of the waxing crescent moon resembles the grin of the Cheshire Cat from Lewis Carroll’s “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” Hawaiian mythology also refers to this phase as the wet moon because it resembles a bowl that could contain liquid, according to NASA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crescent moon will briefly appear just above the western horizon and set about two minutes later. Mercury, which will continue to climb higher into the sky after sunset in the coming days, will be a few degrees above the moon. Venus will be above both Mercury and the moon, according to EarthSky.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crescent moon, Venus and Mercury will continue to appear in a line through Sunday, according to EarthSky.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let bright Venus be your guide, it’s going to show up first because it’s higher in the sky, it’s obviously brighter,” Curran said. “So once you find Venus, below it towards the horizon look for a skinny little moon and Mercury.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Goss predicts that Jupiter will be high in the southern sky and remain visible for another couple of months, while Mars, high in the eastern sky, will be observable for another three to four months.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A string of planets\n",
      "The reason all the planets seem aligned in the night sky is because of their orbits around the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All of our planets go around the sun in a flat disk,” Schmoll said. “From our perspective on Earth, that disk looks like a curved line across the sky stretching from east to the west. As a result, all our planets will always be seen along this line. When we have multiple planets visible, that line can look quite spectacular.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, the planets are spread along the plane they orbit around the sun, called the ecliptic, because of their separate motions. But in February, the planets are all on the same side of the sun from our perspective on Earth, causing them to appear together in the night sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This February is special because instead of being spaced far apart, they happen to be found along just a part of the path, so they all show up in the sky at the same time,” said Seth Jacobson, an assistant professor in the College of Natural Science’s department of Earth and environmental sciences at Michigan State University.\n",

      "Astronomers have spied a monster radio jet in the distant universe that’s twice the width of the Milky Way galaxy. The ancient object formed when the universe was less than 10% of its current age of 13.8 billion years, according to a new study.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is the largest radio jet seen thus far in the early Universe,” said lead author Anniek Gloudemans, a postdoctoral research fellow at the National Science Foundation’s NOIRLab, in an email.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until now, these faraway colossal radio jets released not long after the big bang have been elusive, mostly escaping detection, and how they are created remains an enigma, according to Gloudemans. “Their absence has previously been attributed to the cosmic microwave background (leftover radiation from 13.8 billion years ago), which diminishes the radio light of such distant objects,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most giant galaxies have a supermassive black hole at their centers. These central engines possess incredibly strong gravitational fields, gobbling up anything that strays too close. Funneling all that material causes some black holes to unleash an extraordinary amount of energy that scientists believe fuel the formation of a quasar — the brightest known objects in the universe. The luminous cores of distant, ancient galaxies, quasars expel jets of energetic matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "By using telescopes to peer into the distant universe and study the phenomena observed there, astronomers can essentially see back in time. The discovery of the huge radio jet is providing a window into the early days of the universe, shedding light on when the first jets formed and how they shaped galaxies over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding an ancient radio jet in the early universe\n",
      "The quasar that produced the two-lobed radio jet formed when the universe was less than 1.2 billion years old, or 9% of its current age, and it has some oddball traits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Astronomically speaking, the quasar, which weighs 450 million times the mass of our sun, is considered to be smaller than typical quasars, which can reach masses that are billions of times heavier than our star.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This seems to indicate that you don’t necessarily need an exceptionally massive black hole … to generate such powerful jets in the early Universe,” Gloudemans said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The double-sided jet is also asymmetrical in multiple ways, including the distances it spans away from the quasar, as well as its brightness, “which seems to indicate that an extreme environment is affecting the lobes,” Gloudemans said.\n",
      "\n",
      "An international team of astronomers first identified the radio jet while using the Low Frequency Array, or LOFAR, Telescope, a network of radio telescopes throughout Europe. Then, the researchers carried out follow-up observations in different wavelengths of light, such as near-infrared using the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph instrument on the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii as well as visible light with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, the different bands of light helped the team piece together details about the large jet and the quasar, named J1601+3102, that produced it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We were searching for quasars with strong radio jets in the early Universe, which helps us understand how and when the first jets are formed and how they impact the evolution of galaxies,” Gloudemans said in a statement. “It’s only because this object is so extreme that we can observe it from Earth, even though it’s really far away. This object shows what we can discover by combining the power of multiple telescopes that operate at different wavelengths.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Discovering a large radio jet in the distant universe suggests there are more waiting to be found, Gloudemans said, and the team is planning more observations to better understand the unusual environment around this particular quasar. Some of the biggest remaining questions include what factors lead to the creation of powerful radio jets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are around a thousand quasars known at this epoch and even earlier in the Universe, so even though they are rare, we definitely know quite a few,” Gloudemans said.\n",
      "“The quasars become extremely luminous by friction from gas and dust falling into the supermassive black hole. In the case of this quasar, part of the material has been launched in the form of two jets. We think that these strong radio jets form in roughly 10% of the quasars. Jets have been found even earlier in the Universe, but never of this monster size.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosmic radio jets near and far\n",
      "A separate team of astronomers, also using LOFAR, announced last fall the detection of Porphyrion, a gargantuan pair of jets spanning a whopping 23 million light-years — that’s 115 times more massive than the newly discovered two-lobed radio jet.\n",
      "\n",
      "But unlike the jet formed by J1601+3102, Porphyrion was found 7.5 billion light-years away from Earth in what’s called the “nearby” universe, rather than the early universe, according to the report published in September.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jets as enormous as Porphyrion would be difficult to detect in the early universe because leftover radiation from the big bang drowns out the radio light released by the jets, Gloudemans said.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, astronomers have long questioned whether long, powerful jets could be spotted in the distant universe because the black holes responsible for them behaved differently in the early universe and were less massive, said Martijn Oei, a postdoctoral scholar in observational astronomy at the California Institute of Technology and the lead author of the September study on Porphyrion. Oei was not involved in the new study.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is exciting is that these authors show that quasars at times when they were less massive than they are today could still generate powerful and long jets,” Oei said in an email. “The Universe was much smaller than it was at Porphyrion’s time, so in a relative sense the contrast is less big! This is an impressive find, and shows that black holes affected the Universe with magnetism, heat and cosmic rays beyond the boundaries of their own galaxies already about a billion years after the Big Bang.”\n",

      "Track and field will never fail to surprise its fans: a sport full of tiny details, where the smallest of margins separates moments of glory from those of agony and heartache.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jamaican discus thrower Rojé Stona learned this the hard way.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he approached the discus circle before his fourth attempt during the men’s final at the Paris Olympics, he didn’t expect that three centimeters (roughly 1.2 inches) would cause a pleasant dilemma for his next career move.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stona – who finished 19th in the 2023 World Athletics Championships and was ranked 12th before competing in the French capital – etched his name into the history books, becoming the first Jamaican to win gold in a throwing event. His 70-meter effort broke the Olympic record set minutes prior by Lithuania’s Mykolas Alekna, a heavy favorite going into the Games.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Winning was something I’ve been thinking about, but to be in the moment, it felt different,” the Jamaican told CNN Sport, reflecting on his victorious night in the Stade de France.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was definitely great because I created a lot of history, and I learned a lot afterwards that I’ve done more than what I thought.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the 25-year-old Stona is now intrigued by a switch to a completely different sport having participated in rookie training camps with the NFL’s Green Bay Packers and New Orleans Saints.\n",
      "\n",
      "He doesn’t have much experience in football – only putting on a helmet for the first time in his debut training session – but would be willing to risk his promising athletics career for a spot on an NFL team’s roster.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If there’s like a 99 percent chance that I’ll make a team, then, obviously, I’ll go for it, but if it’s like one or two, though, I got to be realistic,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In December, Stona was announced as one of the 14 athletes to be included in the NFL’s International Player Pathway (IPP) Program class of 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IPP offers a chance for athletes around the world to train with NFL teams, learning the sport and potentially earn a spot on a roster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inspired by legends\n",
      "Stona was only nine when compatriot Usain Bolt won his first Olympic gold medal in Beijing 2008. Despite soccer being his first love, seeing the greatest sprinter of all time win at the Olympics was a big driver in pursuing a career in track and field.\n",
      "\n",
      "After trying many of the sports in athletics, he settled on his future discipline in high school.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I yanked it, it just dropped right out of 20 meters,” Stona recalled the first moment he picked up a discus.\n",
      "\n",
      "After moving through the ranks and representing the Caribbean nation in youth competitions, Stona moved to the US to study at Clemson and later Arkansas.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Fayetteville, he met Ryan Crouser – a three-time Olympic gold medalist and an Olympic record holder in shot put – who joined the Razorbacks’ athletics staff in 2019 as a volunteer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mentorship from “one of the best that have ever done it” throughout the last year of his collegiate eligibility filled Stona with confidence; he watched and soaked in Crouser’s knowledge while trying to replicate his success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The journey to glory\n",
      "The road to the Olympics started with a statement performance for Stona, a 69-meter throw in April during the Oklahoma Throws Series World Invitational meet to guarantee the Jamaican a spot in Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stona had ambitious goals in Paris, aiming to “at least finish top three.” He didn’t want to spend another summer wondering ‘what if?’\n",
      "\n",
      "When competition started, it seemed like everything was going according to a pre-written script: Alekna broke his father Virgilijus’ Olympic record which had stood since 2004, and it looked like the Lithuanian was on track for gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Stona had other plans: his fourth attempt on the night sailed 70 meters, breaking the Olympic record set minutes earlier and causing one of the biggest upsets of the Games.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When Mykolas broke the record, I was like, ‘Alright, I could expect that.’ I gave him my respect because we are throwers; I used to watch Alekna’s dad when I just started discus,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“From the way that I held the discus, the angle of where I caught the discus in my power position, the speed of my right arm coming around, that’s something I’ve been aiming for, and I’m just blessed that it came at the right moment,” Stona said of his moment in the spotlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody is unique in their own way, and that throw for me was one of the best throws ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Stona had practiced celebrations during his time in the Olympic Village out of boredom, and now they came out in full force. He did both Yusuf Dikeç’s casual and nonchalant shooting pose that went viral and Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham’s iconic pose to celebrate his moment of glory.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Learning a new language’\n",
      "During his preparation for the biggest moment of his career, Stona went on a short break from discus training to take part in two NFL rookie camps with the Packers and the Saints during the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "He instantly fell in love with football after being exposed to the game while studying at Clemson, and was one of the few track and field college athletes invited to show what he’s capable of in a sport he has never played before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stona was described by veteran NFL analyst Lance Zierlein as “a track standout with an NFL body type and traits … who possesses explosive hips and above-average core strength to pair with very long arms and huge hands.” His invite to the camps, therefore, was no surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trying out as a defensive end and tight end, Stona described his first camp in Green Bay as “a different world” and “like learning a new language” as he had to rapidly change the mindset from a fan to a student of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The coaches are not going to be like, ‘Oh, he’s new to football, let’s break it down for him,’” he said. “That’s why they are trying to test every rookie because I’m just like one of the rookies, I’m a trial guy, so they’re not making it easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I watched the guys that go in front of me and try to make sure that I do similar or mimic what they’ve done and be coachable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While the current NFL season is underway, it’s looking likely that Stona won’t get picked up by any team mid-season – he said that he wants to prioritize rest and recovery after a long athletics season – but he admitted he feels interested to see what he can do wearing a helmet and shoulder pads.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everywhere I go, people don’t ask, ‘Hey, you’re a discus thrower?’ No, people don’t ask that!” said Stona. “Especially being around in the States, they ask, ‘Do you play football?’\n",
      "\n",
      "“As soon as I get advice from agents and coaches, that will put me in a better position to make a very important decision or just be more decisive if it’s worth it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If that part leads me there, then I’m going to give it my all because it’s kind of now or never. I’m curious as to what I can do on the field, and if I end up playing in the NFL, that would be a part of my legacy – I’d love to do that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as Stona’s promising athletics career goes, he says he wants to use every chance to compete at a high level and aims to compete at every major championship over the next two seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gold medal in Paris gave Stona “some next level of confidence” to pick up where he left off. He finished second in his Diamond League debut in Rome, and with an impressive win in the French capital on his resume, he could settle into the discus throwing elite for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now that I’ve thrown 70 meters, I’ve gotten used to that type of distance, I know what it takes to get there,” Stona said. “So now there’s definitely a chance that I can still compete at a high level.”\n",

      " — \n",
      "It’s a two-for-one cosmic deal. NASA’s newest space telescope, SPHEREx — designed to seek out the key ingredients for life in the Milky Way — and a sun-focused mission called PUNCH are on their way to space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both missions lifted off together aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 11:10 p.m. ET (8:10 p.m PT) Tuesday from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n",
      "\n",
      "The launch comes after weather and integration issues — which cropped up as engineers attached both missions to the rocket and encapsulated them within a protective faring — caused a series of delays after the window of opportunity originally opened on February 28.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the missions have entirely different goals, launching PUNCH as a secondary rideshare along with SPHEREx helps get “more science into space for less cost,” said Dr. Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. And it helps that the missions are going to a similar place: a sun-synchronous orbit around Earth’s poles, meaning each spacecraft keeps the same orientation relative to the sun throughout the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "SPHEREx, or the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer, aims to shed light on how the universe has evolved and find where life’s key ingredients originated in the cosmos.\n",
      "\n",
      "PUNCH, or Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere, will study how the sun affects the solar system. The mission will observe the sun’s hot outer atmosphere, called the corona, and study solar wind, or the energized particles that emerge in a steady stream from the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both groundbreaking missions promise to reveal previously unseen and unknown aspects of our solar system and galaxy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These missions cover the full breadth of the science that NASA does every day,” said Dr. Mark Clampin, acting deputy associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “PUNCH … will study the sun in great detail, whereas SPHEREx is a survey mission that will scan the full sky and will observe hundreds of millions of stars. So every minute of the day, NASA science missions are exploring the universe at different scales to really help us understand the universe we live in and understand the sun that keeps our planet alive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The star stuff of life\n",
      "After launching, SPHEREx will spend just over two years orbiting Earth from 404 miles (650 kilometers) overhead, collecting data on more than 450 million galaxies. The telescope also will survey more than 100 million stars in our galaxy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mapping the distribution of the galaxies will help scientists to understand a cosmic phenomenon called inflation, or what sparked the universe to increase in size by a trillion-trillionfold nearly instantaneously after the big bang.\n",
      "\n",
      "The observatory will create a map of the sky in 102 colors of infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye and ideal for studying stars and galaxies. The telescope will split infrared light into individual wavelengths, like a prism. The different colors of light can help scientists uncover the composition of celestial objects by isolating their chemical compounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are the first mission to look at the whole sky in so many colors,” said Jamie Bock, SPHEREx principal investigator at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology, both in Pasadena, California, in a statement. “Whenever astronomers look at the sky in a new way, we can expect discoveries.”\n",
      "\n",
      "SPHEREx will also measure the total glow of light emitted by all galaxies, including those that are too distant and faint to be detected by other telescopes, to provide a broad look at all the major sources of light across the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of SPHEREx’s main goals is to search for evidence of water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and other ingredients necessary for life frozen within the clouds of gas and dust that give rise to planets and stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, astronomers are eager to look inside molecular clouds, or giant regions full of gas and dust, that may contain newly formed stars. It’s likely that these stars will be ringed by disks of material, which form planets. Astronomers believe ice connected to small dust grains is where most of the water in the universe can be found — and is likely where the water that created Earth’s oceans originated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinpointing the ingredients for life across our galaxy, and their abundance, will enable researchers to determine how they could be incorporated into newly forming planets.\n",
      "\n",
      "SPHEREx will act like a partner for the James Webb Space Telescope. While Webb is a targeted telescope, meaning it observes a small area but in greater detail, SPHEREx is a survey telescope that observes large portions of the sky quickly. Combining the data from both telescopes can connect fine details with the bigger picture. If SPHEREx spots something of interest, then Webb or the Hubble Space Telescope can zoom in on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Packing a punch\n",
      "PUNCH is a constellation of four small suitcase-size spacecraft that will spend the next two years whirling around Earth to observe the sun and the heliosphere, or the sun’s bubble of magnetic fields and particles that extends well beyond the orbit of Pluto.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each satellite carries a camera, which acts like a synchronized, single, virtual instrument with a largely uninterrupted view of the sun. The cameras are equipped with polarizing filters, similar to polarized sunglasses, that enable them to make maps of features in the corona and across the solar system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, the four satellites will create global, 3D observations of where the sun’s outer atmosphere transitions to become the solar wind to help scientists understand how this process occurs. PUNCH will also glimpse how the corona and solar wind affect the rest of the solar system. It will be the first mission to image the corona and solar wind together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solar wind, as well as solar storms, are responsible for space weather that can affect Earth, creating beautiful auroras near the poles but also interfering with communications satellites and triggering outages of power grids. Measurements collected by PUNCH will help scientists better understand how solar storms form and evolve, which could lead to accurate predictions for when space weather could impact Earth. PUNCH will be observing the sun at a crucial time during solar maximum, or the peak of the sun’s activity during its 11-year cycle, when more flares and solar storms are expected to occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What we hope PUNCH will bring to humanity is the ability to really see, for the first time, where we live inside the solar wind itself,” said Craig DeForest, principal investigator for PUNCH at Southwest Research Institute’s Solar System Science and Exploration Division in Boulder, Colorado, in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like SPHEREx and the Webb telescope, PUNCH will be able to work in tandem with NASA’s Parker Solar Probe, which launched in 2018 and recently made its closest pass to the sun, to capture the bigger picture as well as close-up details.\n",
      "\n",
      "“PUNCH is the latest heliophysics addition to the NASA fleet that delivers groundbreaking science every second of every day,” said Joe Westlake, director of NASA’s heliophysics division, in a statement. “Launching this mission as a rideshare bolsters its value to the nation by optimizing every pound of launch capacity to maximize the scientific return for the cost of a single launch.”\n",

      "NASA confirmed Thursday that the space agency may have sidestepped the sweeping layoffs it was expected to implement this week, potentially saving hundreds of newly hired employees and career professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement, the agency said it worked with the Office of Personnel Management — which has been at the forefront of the Trump administration’s efforts to downsize the federal workforce — on “a careful evaluation of our workforce and mission requirements.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Those discussions led to a determination that job cuts for probationary employees, typically those hired within the past year, will be “performance-based or voluntary in accordance with agency policy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That move stands in contrast to orders at some other federal agencies in which probationary employees were ordered to be cut across the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The agency will continue to monitor all employee performances and take swift action as appropriate with any issues, ensuring American citizens have an excellent and efficient workforce at NASA,” the space agency’s statement reads.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, roughly 5% of NASA’s workforce accepted offers under the deferred resignation program — which was a move by the Trump administration to lure federal employees to step down from their roles in exchange for being paid through September, the space agency said. That figure includes a “small subset” of probationary employees, NASA said.\n",
      "\n",
      "NASA employs nearly 18,000 people, according to the space agency, so roughly 900 workers may have taken that offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "One NASA employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive topics, expressed concern about how patents and intellectual property may be affected if NASA workers leave their job but are still on the agency’s payroll for the months ahead. It’s not clear how intellectual property issues might play out legally in that regard, the source said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Concerns in space community\n",
      "According to two sources familiar with the matter, there were about 1,300 probationary workers at NASA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prospect of all probationary employees losing their jobs set off alarm bells in the space community.\n",
      "\n",
      "The head of space policy at the nonprofit Planetary Society, which is led by Bill Nye and advocates for space exploration, said in a statement that the “indiscriminate dismissal of upwards of 1,000 scientists, engineers, and explorers at NASA” would mark “the largest involuntary workforce reduction since the end of the Apollo program.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Those Apollo-era layoffs at NASA occurred “when we were winding down a moon program,” Planetary Society chief of space policy Casey Dreier told CNN. “But we’re actively spinning one up right now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dreier was referring to the Artemis program, which seeks to return astronauts to the lunar surface as soon as mid-2027, according to the most recent timeline NASA mapped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Dreier’s research, NASA employed more than 35,000 people as the Apollo program reached its peak in the late 1960s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the Apollo program, however, NASA intends to outsource much of the work on its Artemis program to the private sector through fixed-price contracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dreier said that the Planetary Society is not advocating for NASA’s head count to grow — or even suggesting workforce reductions won’t help the agency become more nimble.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem, however, is “the blunt, non-strategic, indiscriminate nature (of the firings) that we’re fundamentally worried about,” he said. “That will hinder NASA’s ability to move forward on its plans.”\n",

      "Despite a tenure in which keeping the Olympics and politics separate has at times been difficult – and in which he’s had to deal with some of the world’s most controversial leaders – Thomas Bach has a clear message for his successors during an uncertain time: make sure the Games stay out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 12 years, Bach has overseen one of the most extraordinary periods in the history of the Olympic movement – a global pandemic with two Games behind closed doors, a state-sponsored Russian doping scandal and a legacy of era-defining change within his organization. That period also saw the Games being hosted in Russia, Brazil, South Korea, China and France amid elections, wars in Europe and the Middle East, and cross-border posturing on the Korean Peninsula.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he prepares to hand over the baton to his successor, Bach does so with an unwavering faith in the power of unity and strict neutrality, and a confidence that the Olympics currently face no “existential challenge or problem.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sport has to be politically neutral, otherwise we cannot accomplish our mission to bring the entire world together. You have seen how perfectly it worked in Paris, where we had the athletes from all the territories of the 206 National Olympic Committees, plus the Refugee Olympic Team, coming together, living together in the Olympic Village, living peacefully together,” he told CNN Sports’ Amanda Davies in an exclusive interview ahead of the selection of his successor.\n",

      "\n",
      "Bach’s message will face a stern test as the Summer Games prepare to head to Los Angeles in 2028. They do so against the backdrop of an increasingly uncertain and fractured political and societal landscape in the United States, which is going through a time of deep political divide – one from which the Olympics have not been immune.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Trump administration’s direct, disruptive style of leadership sits in stark contrast to the IOC’s diplomatic and unifying mission, and that combination could present those protected principles with their biggest test in generations.\n",

      "Despite the differences, the 71-year-old German is confident that President Donald Trump – who was serving his first term when 2028 was awarded to Los Angeles – has the Games’ best interest at heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m very confident about the support of President Trump for the Games in LA because I have experienced him as a very outspoken supporter and promoter of the candidature of Los Angeles, and there you could also feel in this exchange that, in his heart, he loves sport,” Bach told CNN Sports.\n",
      "\n",

      "Gold-medal boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting – whose participation in Paris became a flashpoint last summer – have been consistently referenced by the president, wrongfully asserting that both were men who “transitioned.” It’s become a flashpoint for an often-misinformed debate about how women are allowed to compete in sports and has subsequently triggered an onslaught of online, transphobic abuse toward athletes.\n",

      "Fighting back against the ‘attack’ on Olympic boxers\n",
      "Trump’s remarks came after the Russian-backed International Boxing Association (IBA) disqualified Khelif and Lin from the 2023 World Championships on the basis of failed eligibility tests, and those athletes once again found their participation scrutinized during last year’s Olympics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IBA and the IOC have shared a fraught and fractured relationship for years, and that feud was only exacerbated in Paris. Just last month, the IBA launched legal action against Khelif and the IOC over the former being allowed to compete at the Games, despite being “ineligible.” The IOC responded by calling it “just another example of IBA’s campaign against the IOC.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bach has staunchly defended both boxers throughout what he says was a Russian-led misinformation campaign during the Games.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The impression was given as if these two boxers (…) would be transgender athletes. They are not,” he explained. “They have been born as women. They have been raised as women. They have been competing as women. They have lost bouts, and they have won bouts. They have even competed in the Olympic Games in Tokyo without any noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can see it was initiated by the Russian head of an international boxing federation, which we had withdrawn recognition of because of issues with the finances, good governance, judging and refereeing – the whole list. And whose expulsion then was also confirmed by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), and then they started, all of a sudden, this Paris attack.”\n",

      "CNN has reached out to the IBA for a response to Bach’s claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khelif has already stated her aspiration to compete in and medal in Los Angeles, with the IOC Executive Board recommending that boxing be part of the 2028 program, following the provisional recognition of World Boxing in February 2025.\n",

      "On Putin and dealing with controversial world leaders\n",
      "Just as Bach’s successor will have to navigate the fine line between upholding the IOC’s core values and confronting several touchpoint issues, the German himself is no stranger to dealing with the multifarious interests and motivations of political leaders from around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bach had a self-confessed “very good relationship” with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, but that relationship dramatically soured with the uncovering of an orchestrated program of cheating at the Games, and then by Russia’s full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "A World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report in July 2016 stated that Russia ran a state-sponsored doping program during the 2014 Winter Olympics, while an update to the report five months later concluded that a “systematic and centralized cover-up” had benefited more than 1,000 Russian athletes across 30 sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial report said Russia engaged in “a shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sport and on the Olympic Games,” tarnishing the country’s powerhouse reputation in the sporting world. The Russian government responded to the scandal by calling the punishments unjust and an example of anti-Russian sentiment. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in 2019 the decision to ban Russia from multiple Games in punishment was “unjust, doesn’t correspond to common sense and the law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Through these Games (in 2014), a number of people were thinking differently about what is going on in Russia, but then with the doping scandal, they completely destroyed it,” Bach told Davies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then this relation got worse and worse and after the invasion (of Ukraine), we had to take new measures. And now we’re in a situation where, in Russia, I’m (called) a Nazi, so I think that says it all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Frequently pictured together over his time as IOC president, there have been allegations that Bach’s relationship with Putin meant that he didn’t take as tough a stance on Russia as some suggested he should. Despite sporting sanctions being imposed against Russia, the country’s athletes were still able to compete at Olympics under specific conditions in the years that followed the WADA report.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Bach denied his relationship with Putin had any effect on his decision making when it came to the participation of Russian athletes at the Games.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all because we applied the same principles we are applying to all the athletes around the world,” he told CNN Sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing what he now knows, does Bach regret the Games ever being staged in the Black Sea resort of Sochi?\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had to make these Games a success despite the fact the election of Sochi happened way before my presidency (in 2007),” he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "“President Putin himself was very interested to make the Games a success, and so the two interests came together. They were elected and then they happened. This is history. It happened. You cannot correct history.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The IOC has allowed Russian athletes to continue competing as individual neutrals at recent Games – albeit without flying the national flag or playing the national anthem.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We had many national Olympic committees being suspended and they were participating then under the Olympic flag or other flags, and the same we applied then also for the Russian athletes in both cases,” Bach said, defending the move.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia was banned from all team sports at last year’s Paris Games and its path back into the Olympic fold remains unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The country’s possible participation at next year’s Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics will be one of the first key decisions taken by the German’s successor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bach is clear, though, that decisions made in the past and going forward should continue to be made with the best interests of the athletes in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not about Russia. It is about the athletes. Everybody who is following the rules has to have the right to participate in the Olympic Games, full stop,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Future stability\n",
      "Participation at the Games has been one of the motivating factors that led Bach to drive through a set of defining changes within the IOC – an organization that he believes had been “longing for reforms.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On the field of play, Rio 2016 marked the first appearance of a Refugee Olympic Team for displaced athletes while Paris witnessed the Games having an equal number of men and women competing.\n",

      "Away from competition, future revenues have been secured to make the Games accessible to a bigger worldwide audience. Last week, the Olympics and NBC announced a $3 billion extension of their media rights deal for the 2034 Salt Lake City Games and the 2036 Games.\n",

      "\n",
      "Many gold medalists from this year’s Olympics in Paris will be enjoying vast bonuses and gifts in reward for their athletic achievements. However, a CNN Sport analysis has found that many of their Paralympic colleagues are being paid less to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "In many countries, National Olympic and Paralympic committees (NOCs and NPCs, respectively) and governing bodies are separate entities and govern their respective sports differently than their counterparts. For example, the United States has one body – the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) – while Australia has two – the Australian Olympic Committee and Paralympics Australia. Similarly, World Athletics and World Para Athletics are distinct bodies governing able-bodied track and field and para track and field respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many NOCs and NPCs are funded through government support and private sources through sponsorship and rights, such as Spain’s. Some, like Great Britain or China, receive a majority of government funding along with other sources (e.g. a national lottery). Others, such as the USOPC, are nonprofit corporations, which have no government funding at all and are reliant on both private investment and the generosity of the population of the country (e.g. the USOPC’s direct fan donation scheme).\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN reached out to Olympic and Paralympic authorities from every nation competing at this year’s Games in Paris – some like Great Britain prohibit or do not allow awards to be given to athletes – and sourced data from reliable local reporting where available. At least 42 countries awarded gold medalists over $100,000 after the Paris Olympics, meanwhile, only 23 countries and Taiwan awarded their Paralympic champions bonuses of this size.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Looking across the world, it is very disappointing that nations place such a varying importance on the funding of their athletes and that the profile and opportunity for para-athletes is often overlooked,” Sarah Storey, Great Britain’s most successful ever Paralympic athlete, told CNN Sport.\n",
      "\n",
      "Singapore’s Paralympic champions earn a bonus of 500,000 Singapore Dollars (around $385,000), the largest figure of any country. However, this is half the sum awarded to Olympic champions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paralympic gold medalists from Hong Kong are awarded HK$1.5 million (around $190,000). While generous, it is 75% smaller than the bonus given to Olympic gold medalists from the city state. Silver Olympic medalists are given considerably larger bonuses – HK$3 million (around $386,000) – than gold Paralympic medalists from Hong Kong.\n",

      "The Vietnamese Olympic Committee reportedly pledged a $1 million bonus to any athlete who won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics. Prospective Paralympic gold medalists from Vietnam were given an incentive of a little over 1% of their Olympic colleagues, at just 400 million Vietnamese dong (around $15,700) – the highest discrepancy identified by CNN.\n",

      "Of the 205 nations and territories competing at Paris 2024, CNN identified at least 74 nations that allow prize money for their Olympic champions, only 30 of which award Olympic and Paralympic champions equal bonuses. CNN was only able to identify 55 countries where prize money was pledged to Paralympic medalists. There are at least 10 nations – including Great Britain, Bangladesh, Iceland, Norway and Yemen – that don’t offer financial rewards to either Olympic or Paralympic gold medalists.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of the rewards provided to medalists by individual nations and Olympic bodies, World Athletics (WA) provides gold medalists in Olympic track and field events $50,000 in prize money. This isn’t the case for Paralympic gold medalists.\n",

      "When reached by CNN, World Para Athletics (WPA) said in a statement: “While World Para Athletics is not in a position to offer prize money in Para athletics events at the moment, we encourage investment in our sport and look forward to the day when we can engage in discussions about how we can reward our amazing athletes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "World Para Athletics also emphasized to CNN that, while WA had 48 medal events at Paris 2024, WPA had 164 medal events at the Paralympic Games in the City of Light, highlighting the additional hurdle of providing funding for over triple the amount of events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite that, nine-time British Paralympic gold medalist Hannah Cockroft told Sky Sports that the discrepancy was “frustrating” and called for parity.\n",

      "“It’s tough seeing the Olympic guys get the money from World Athletics and then we can’t replicate, it’s frustrating” she told the British broadcaster. “That would really pay for my wedding quite well. Ultimately, I do this because I love it. We want parity and that’s what we push for every time.”\n",

      "Brittain added the differential between Paralympic and Olympic champions “reinforces much of the other systemic and structural discrimination disabled people encounter on a daily basis that makes their lives both more difficult and more expensive than most non-disabled people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such an approach, he added, rewards disabled athletes “less than a non-disabled person when their achievements were probably both more expensive to them personally and harder to achieve given the barriers (environmental and attitudinal) they have had to overcome to reach that level.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Despite the disparity in financial bonuses, Paralympic athletes from around the world also returned home to a wide variety of gifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, the Malaysian government pledged RM 1 million (around $235,000) plus a lifetime monthly stipend of RM 5,000 (roughly $1,113) to individual athletes who won gold in either the Olympics and Paralympics. However, only two of their athletes – both Paralympians, badminton player Cheah Liek Hou and powerlifter Bonnie Bunyau Gustin – took home a gold medal from Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much like their Olympic colleagues, para-athletes who won gold medals from Uzbekistan were awarded a Chevy Tahoe SUV and a two-story cottage, according to local media reports. Their silver and bronze medal-winning colleagues were also awarded a car and an apartment.\n",

      "Turning of the tides?\n",
      "While there is still disparity in how Paralympic and Olympic champions are rewarded by their home nations, there is evidence that this is changing.\n",

      "Several countries have recently achieved bonus parity for their Paralympic and Olympic champions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Canada is one of the more recent nations to adopt this approach, with the Canadian Olympic Committee and the Canadian Paralympic Committee announcing in January 2024 that both sets of athletes would be awarded CA$20,000 (around $14,500) for a gold medal.\n",

Almost £70 million (nearly $91 million) was provided for the Paralympics, split between 20 sports – or £3.5 million ($4.55 million) per sport.\n",

Typically, few sports besides football and basketball drive a profit, but the NCAA is in a new era with name, image and likeness (NIL) deals and student-athletes being treated more like employees. Gymnastics has long been familiar with private organizations separate from schools because many kids grow up competing in clubs when their schools don’t offer the sport.\n",
      "\n",
      "NIL deals stem from an NCAA policy change in 2021, allowing student-athletes to profit from sponsorship opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The move came after California started a nationwide trend in 2019 by passing a law entitling athletes to earn endorsement money, followed by a landmark 2021 U.S. Supreme Court decision that said student-athletes could receive education-related payments, reshaping the landscape of college sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see a place with NIL where there could be some kind of fusion between this private enterprise model and college athletics, and if we are smart and we’re moving in the right direction, which I believe we are, there’s actually a surprising amount of opportunities for gymnastics, where other sports don’t necessarily have that same specialization and that same privatized model in place already,” Payne said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combining this possibility with the surge of popularity from the Olympics offers a light on the horizon for men’s gymnastics.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In my coaching career, this is probably one of the most optimistic points for me,” Payne told CNN. “We do have something that people are interested in and hopefully this moment with the Olympics, with the success with whatever cultural buttons Stephen Nedoroscik has managed to push, we can capitalize on that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nedoroscik, a bronze medalist for the US in the team event and on the pommel horse, has already benefited the sport in ways that probably won’t be seen for years. The Athletic reported that his hometown gym has had unprecedented interest from parents trying to sign their sons up for classes. He recently appeared on the Tonight Show, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pommel horse specialist surprised many when he made the Team USA squad given he only competes in one event of the six in men’s gymnastics. But the Americans’ gamble paid off when his performance played a large role in securing bronze in the team event – not to mention his solo success.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he is very skilled technically, Nedoroscik’s personality was what really captured the public’s attention, between the thick-rimmed glasses he removes for competition – with the internet dubbing him the “Clark Kent” of Team USA – meditation on the sidelines while he waits for his event and his love for Rubik’s cubes.\n",
      "\n",
      "His college coach Randy Jepson sees Nedoroscik as an example of the type of kid who would thrive with gymnastics.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are so many boys out there that maybe don’t fit into a niche for basketball or football or soccer, and they’re maybe a little bit different. They look at life a little differently,” Jepson said. “They’re maybe more cerebral and still want to have that athletic opportunity. Gymnastics provides that because it’s so challenging and so exciting and it’s just so fun.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The other coaches CNN spoke to recognize this view too – gymnastics interest a certain type of kid and they need programs available at all ages to nurture that interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw [guys] that had real potential, maybe not Olympic level potential, but had real potential to be good gymnasts that stepped away from it because they got to high school and they realized there aren’t a lot of opportunities,” Payne said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to sustain and build on the team everyone loved at the Olympics, there needs to be opportunities from youth to high school to the collegiate level.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With our sport, there’s no pro level. Really, the Olympics is the pro for us,” Payne said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many elite women gymnasts turn pro right out of high school, but nearly everyone on the US men’s national team is either currently in college or already graduated. That means Olympians compete in NCAA meets every weekend and fans of the sport can see those world-class skills without traveling to Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The product that people get to see at a high level when they go to an NCAA championship, even a conference championship, is Olympic level gymnastics,” Jepson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while all of these teams compete and want to beat each other, they also understand that they share the same struggle of growing their sport.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think for men’s gym, we are kind of in this fight together of growing our sport and it’s going in such a great direction,” Greenville University Head Coach Zach Peters told CNN Sport. “And I think it is rare, what men’s gym has, and I think people would be surprised to see the relationships that we have within the head coaches.”\n",

      "\n",
      "It has been six months since Wilson won relay gold as a 16-year-old at the Paris Olympics, becoming the youngest male track and field champion in history. Already that feels like a distant memory, his foot firmly on the gas as he returns to indoor racing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m just getting back to work,” Wilson tells CNN Sport. “No gold medal, none of that in mind. When I’m practicing, I’m worrying about my future goals, nothing in the past. I can’t go and change what I’ve done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s easy to forget, despite his near-constant boyish grin, that Wilson is still a high school student. He won’t graduate from Maryland’s Bullis School until next year, and in the meantime continues to pursue his sporting ambitions alongside lessons and homework.\n",
      "\n",
      "That means waking up at 5 a.m. each day and getting on the bus around 6:15 to arrive at school for 7:30. “Do I like early mornings? No,” says Wilson, “but I have to do what I gotta do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A full day of school follows, after which he has practice at the track from 3 to 6 p.m. Then it’s back home for more schoolwork and preparing for any tests he might have the next day – hardly a typical schedule for someone who emerged as one of the fastest 400-meter runners in the world last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "But schoolwork, Wilson stresses, is of upmost importance to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think I’m more focused in the classroom than I am on the track, and that can tell you a lot,” he explains. “My grade average is an A average throughout this semester already. All my life, I’ve all had an A average, I think, so nothing has changed.”\n",

      "\n",
      "For now, Wilson’s attentions are on the indoor season, using his weekends to travel to meets on the East Coast. He broke his own indoor high school 400-meter record in Boston last weekend, clocking 45.66 seconds around two laps of the track, and will race in the 600-meters at the Millrose Games in New York City on Saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "With one record already to his name this year, Wilson could target another – Will Sumner’s high school 600m record of 1:15.58 – at the Millrose Games, though it would involve lowering his time from last year by almost two seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m just going out there to try to run my best, and if I see 1:15 on the clock, I’ll be super ecstatic,” he says. “But right now, my goal is just to get around the track and try to stay with everyone in the race.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Given his young age and incredible promise – plus his recently acquired status as an Olympic gold medalist – there will undoubtedly be heightened attention on Wilson’s performances this season.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shot to fame at last year’s US Olympic Trials, twice breaking the under-18 400m world record before finishing sixth in the final. That wasn’t enough for an individual spot on the team, but it did earn Wilson a place in the relay pool, making him the youngest US man to compete in track and field at the Olympics.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Paris, weeks after setting another under-18 record of 44.2 seconds, he was far from his best, coming in seventh at the end of the first leg in the 4x400m relay heats. But the US team of Wilson, Vernon Norwood, Bryce Deadmon and Christopher Bailey still secured a spot in the final and went on to win gold as hurdles specialist Rai Benjamin swapped into the team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Running in the heats was still enough to earn Wilson a medal, and he recently revealed that he had sustained a hamstring injury soon after earning a spot on the Olympic team. Despite that, and despite running considerably slower than at the trials, he describes the Olympic experience as a “dream come true” and “the best thing that could ever happen to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of Wilson’s summer was taken up by engagements and invites, still rolling in thick and fast today. He met Jay-Z, visited colleges, and went to baseball and football games around Baltimore; a huge Ravens fan, he spent time at the team’s facility, had his photo taken with quarterback Lamar Jackson, and was gifted cleats by wide receiver Zay Flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another life, Wilson might have contemplated a career in the NFL. He was the leading scorer on his high school team during freshman year and only made the decision to focus solely on track at the age of 15.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Man, I miss football so much,” he says. “If I could go play football right now, I would. If they invited me to the Super Bowl over the biggest track meet, I don’t know which one I would choose, honestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I grew up playing football and running track. I knew my end goals for track, what I wanted to do, and it’s hard – every day I think about it, because I just want to go back and play (football) right now. I just want to go outside and throw a football around, but I know I’ve done a lot of great things in track.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the Ravens, Wilson says that he “was almost in tears” when tight end Mark Andrews dropped a game-tying two-point conversion in the team’s recent divisional round defeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re inching closer and closer to the Super Bowl,” he adds. “You guys are gonna see us in a couple years. I’m telling you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Unbelievably, Wilson was only four years old during the Ravens’ last Super Bowl appearance in 2012. He has since grown into one of the most exciting young athletes of his generation, already racing against – and beating – far more experienced opponents.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that time, he has remained unfazed by his fast-tracked rise to senior racing. The stakes might be higher, the competition fiercer, but the basic act of completing a single lap of a running track as fast as possible is still the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They put the spikes on the same way I do,” says Wilson. “We line up the same way I do, we get in the blocks the same way. So I feel like it’s nothing different. You may be 6’10”, and I may be 4’11”, but at the end of the day, we’ve got to run and we’ve got to run together.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll see a lot of 16-year-olds like, ‘Yeah, I’m going to just let you win.’ But for me, I’m not letting anybody win. I’m ready to fight to the line as well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At 5’9”, Wilson is shorter and physically less developed than most of his rivals. Yet more striking is the way in which he runs. Head tilted back, arms flapping at the side of his body – it’s hardly conventional form for a sprinter.\n",
      "\n",
      "But being unconventional is also part of Wilson’s modus operandi, central to the dichotomy between his life as an elite runner and high school student. He’s part Olympian and gold medalist, part schoolboy figuring out when to do his homework and when to get his driver’s license.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, Wilson has placed things like getting his license on hold. However, he has spent a lot of the past 12 months remembering that “you’re a kid and a 16-year-old who’s going to school and having fun and doing a lot of cool things that a teenager’s doing.”\n",

      " — \n",
      "With its iconic rusty hue, Mars has long been called the red planet. Now, scientists may have discovered the potential source of that distinctive coloring, overturning a popular theory in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mars is one of the most well-studied planets in our solar system due to its proximity to Earth and the numerous spacecraft that have visited over the past few decades. Together, orbiters and landers have provided scientists with data showing that Mars’ red color comes from rusted iron minerals within the dust that coats the planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "At some point, iron within rocks on Mars reacted with water or water and oxygen in the air, creating iron oxide — much in the same way rust forms on Earth. Over billions of years, the iron oxide broke down into dust and settled across the planet after being moved by Martian winds, which still spins up dust devils and massive dust storms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous analyses of iron oxide on Mars, based only on observations by spacecraft, didn’t detect any evidence of water, which led researchers to believe that the iron oxide must be hematite. The dry mineral, a main component of iron ore, was thought to have formed through reactions with the Martian atmosphere in a process that occurred over billions of years. If that was the case, the hematite would have formed later in Mars’ history, after it was suspected of hosting lakes and rivers on its surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "New research combining data from multiple missions and replicated Martian dust has suggested a mineral that forms in the presence of cool water may be responsible for the red hue, rather than hematite, which could change the way scientists understand what Mars was like millions of years ago — and whether it was potentially habitable. A team of scientists reported the findings Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mars is still the Red Planet,” said lead study author Adomas Valantinas, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Brown University, in a statement. “It’s just that our understanding of why Mars is red has been transformed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sifting through the dust\n",
      "Scientists have wondered about the exact composition of the iron oxide in Martian dust, because understanding how it formed would enable them to essentially look back in time at what the environment and climate were like on ancient Mars.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, even though dust covers everything on Mars, it’s difficult to study and presents an enigma, said Briony Horgan, co-investigator on the Perseverance rover mission and professor of planetary science at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Horgan was not involved in the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The particles (of oxidized iron) are so small (nanometers or less) that they don’t really have a defined crystal structure and can’t be called true minerals,” Horgan said. “There are ways to form oxidized iron without water, and some proposed dry processes include surface oxidation like the oxidation rinds that form in rocks in the Antarctic Dry Valleys, and surface oxidation by abrasion as the surface is blasted with sand grains over long periods. But there are also lots of ways to oxidize with water too, including in soils and lakes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The new analysis points to a different type of iron oxide that contains water called ferrihydrite, which forms quickly in cool water — and likely formed on Mars when water could still exist on the surface before the planet grew colder and more inhospitable. Previous research has suggested ferrihydrite as a possible cause of Mars’ redness, but the new study has combined lab methods with observational data for the first time to offer up evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This paper is trying to figure out which specific poorly crystalline iron oxide could be responsible for the red component of Mars dust, which would be helpful to work out as that could help us determine which process produced the dust and when that occurred,” Horgan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Valantinas and his team made use of data collected by the European Space Agency’s Mars Express orbiter and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, as well as NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Curiosity, Pathfinder, and Opportunity rovers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Trace Gas Orbiter’s CaSSIS color camera, also known as the Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System, revealed the exact size and composition of dust particles on Mars, allowing the researchers to make their own version on Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scientists created their own Martian dust in a laboratory using different types of iron oxide. The replica dust was put through a specialized grinder to create grains equal in size to those on Mars with a thickness equivalent to 1/100th of a human hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team analyzed the dust with X-ray machines and reflectance spectrometers, similar to the techniques used by orbiters studying Mars as they circle the planet. Then, the scientists compared the lab data with spacecraft data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mars Express’ OMEGA reflectance spectrometer showed that even the dustiest parts of Mars hold evidence of water-rich minerals, while data from CaSSIS pointed to the presence of ferrihydrite as the best match for dust on Mars, rather than hematite, when compared with the lab samples, Valantinas said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instrument has been observing Mars since April 2018, capturing high-resolution color images of the Martian surface, said Nicolas Thomas, a professor at the Physics Institute at the University of Bern in Switzerland who led the team that developed the camera.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We found that ferrihydrite mixed with basalt, a volcanic rock, best fits the minerals seen by spacecraft at Mars,” said Valantinas, who began his research at the University of Bern using Trace Gas Orbiter data. “The major implication is that because ferrihydrite could only have formed when water was still present on the surface, Mars rusted earlier than we previously thought. Moreover, the ferrihydrite remains stable under present-day conditions on Mars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A watery past\n",
      "The mystery of Mars’ red hue has persisted for thousands of years, Valantinas said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Romans named Mars for their god of war because its color was reminiscent of blood and Egyptians called the planet “Her Desher,” meaning “the red one,” according to the European Space Agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Discovering that Mars’ hue may be due to a water-containing rusty mineral like ferrihydrite, as opposed to hematite’s waterless form of rust, surprised the researchers, Valantinas said. But it provides intriguing clues about Mars’ geologic and climate history, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Since this water-containing rust blankets most of the Martian surface, it suggests that liquid water in Mars’ ancient past may have been more widespread than previously thought,” Valantinas said. “This suggests that Mars once had an environment where liquid water was present, which is an essential prerequisite for life. Our study reveals that ferrihydrite formation on Mars required the presence of both oxygen — whether from the atmosphere or other sources — and water capable of reacting with iron.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The study wasn’t focused on determining when exactly the mineral formed. However, since ferrihydrite forms in cool water, it’s possible that it was created about 3 billion years ago, as opposed to when the planet was warmer and wetter millions of years before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This was a time of intense volcanic activity on Mars that likely triggered ice-melting events and interactions between water and rock, providing conditions favorable for ferrihydrite formation,” Valantinas said. “The timing aligns with a period when Mars was transitioning from its earlier, wetter state to its current desert environment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s possible that in addition to being in the dust, ferrihydrite is also in layers of Martian rock. And the best way to tell will be to obtain actual samples of rocks and dust from the red planet. The Perseverance rover has already collected multiple samples containing both, and NASA and ESA are hoping to use a complex series of missions under the Mars Sample Return program to return them to Earth by the early 2030s.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once we get these precious samples into the lab, we’ll be able to measure exactly how much ferrihydrite the dust contains, and what this means for our understanding of the history of water — and the possibility for life — on Mars,” said Colin Wilson, ESA’s Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express project scientist, in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the findings present new mysteries for Valantinas and his colleagues to solve, including the original source location of the ferrihydrite before it was distributed globally across Mars through dust storms and the exact chemical composition of Mars’ atmosphere when the ferrihydrite formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding when and where the dust formed could help scientists gain insights into how the atmospheres of early Earth-like planets evolved, Horgan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ferrihydrite is really common in soils on Earth that have a lot of water moving through them in a short period of time, either because of snow melt or short periods of intense rainfall in warmer climates,” Horgan said. “We’ve also seen evidence for ferrihydrite in the lake sediments at (Mars’) Gale crater (which is being explored by the Curiosity rover). The best way to really solve this puzzle would be to get a sample of Mars dust into our labs back on Earth.”\n",

      " — \n",
      "A crew of international astronauts slated to launch to the International Space Station on a mission that will take the reins from NASA’s Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, allowing them to return home after an unexpectedly extended and politically charged journey, will have to wait a bit longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Crew-10 flight, part of a routine ISS staff rotation, is jointly operated by NASA and SpaceX. Takeoff was slated for Wednesday evening from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, but the company called off the launch attempt because of an issue with the launchpad’s ground system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem stemmed from a hydraulics system used to control one of two clamps that hold on to the upper portion of the rocket as it sits vertically on the ground pad before launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a ground issue. Everything was fine with the rocket and the spacecraft,” NASA spokesperson Darrol Nail said on the livestream.\n",
      "\n",
      "NASA said late Wednesday that liftoff for the Crew-10 mission is now scheduled for no earlier than Friday at 7:03 p.m. ET.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the mission launches, a SpaceX Dragon capsule, riding atop one of the company’s Falcon 9 rockets, will carry the four Crew-10 astronauts — NASA’s Nichole Ayers and Anne McClain, Takuya Onishi with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov — to orbit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once at the space station, Ayers, McClain, Onishi and Peskov will spend a few days acclimating to the orbiting laboratory during a handover period with the Crew-9 astronauts, a team that includes Williams and Wilmore, as well as NASA’s Nick Hague and Roscosmos’ Aleksandr Gorbunov.\n",
      "\n",
      "Williams, Wilmore and the rest of Crew-9 will return to Earth once that handover period concludes. The Crew-9 team was slated to undock from the station on March 16 if the Wednesday’s launch attempt was successful. It’s not clear how much the departure may shift now that SpaceX has called off a possible liftoff Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Williams and Wilmore have been in orbit since last June when they piloted the inaugural crewed test flight of Boeing’s Starliner capsule. They expected to remain in space for about a week. But numerous issues detected during their trip to the ISS, including helium leaks and propulsion issues, prompted NASA to deem the Starliner vehicle too risky to return with astronauts on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Crew-9 and Crew-10 are part of routine operations carried out by NASA and SpaceX to keep the space station fully staffed, the missions have become the focus of public controversy involving claims by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk — the SpaceX CEO who is now a top presidential adviser — about former President Joe Biden’s administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though NASA announced in August — before the 2024 election or Trump’s inauguration — that it planned to return Williams and Wilmore to Earth on a SpaceX vehicle, Musk has this year repeatedly claimed that Trump’s predecessor denied an offer from SpaceX to bring Williams and Wilmore home earlier for “political reasons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk has not said what exactly may have been proposed or to whom it was offered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "An extended stay in space\n",
      "A former senior NASA official told CNN that SpaceX never communicated such a proposition to agency leadership — and NASA likely would not have entertained the idea regardless.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Musk had made the offer to someone outside NASA leadership, the source noted, “I’m sure they would have responded and said, ‘Well, that would cost us several $100 million extra that we don’t have for a new Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 (rocket).’”\n",
      "\n",
      "And in an August 2024 news conference, Steve Stich, the program manager for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, told reporters that the space agency “never considered that option” — referring to the idea of flying a separate SpaceX mission dedicated to retrieving Williams and Wilmore rather than returning them to Earth aboard a routine, prescheduled flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It just didn’t make sense to go ahead and accelerate a (SpaceX) flight to return Butch and Suni earlier,” Stich said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Musk has said in interviews and social media posts that he made the offer to and was rebuffed by the Biden White House — though it’s not clear why he would not have brought the proposal to mission organizers at NASA.\n",
      "\n",
      "A former White House staffer did not respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "When NASA made the bombshell announcement in August 2024 that the Starliner would fly home empty, Williams and Wilmore were reassigned to a SpaceX crew mission. That meant the pair would join the official ISS staff and Crew-9, which launched in September with two seats empty for Williams and Wilmore to occupy.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Crew-9 was originally slated to return as soon as February, however, NASA said in December the mission would be delayed to late March because of issues with a new Crew Dragon capsule SpaceX was preparing to fly the Crew-10 astronauts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last month, the space agency announced SpaceX would move up the Crew-10 launch date several weeks by opting to use a different, previously flown Crew Dragon capsule for the mission.\n",
      "\n",
      "NASA has maintained that it’s essential to launch the Crew-10 staff to the ISS and allow the dayslong handover to take place prior to Williams, Wilmore and the rest of the Crew-9 astronauts returning to Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Williams and Wilmore’s comments\n",
      "The decision to keep Williams and Wilmore on the ISS rather than launch an emergency mission to return them to Earth was made as part of NASA’s efforts to keep the space station fully staffed. It allowed the veteran astronauts to step in and aid day-to-day activity on the orbiting lab, as both had been trained before their Starliner test flight to join the ISS crew as part of NASA’s contingency planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The space agency seeks to keep at least four representatives from the US and its partner countries on board the laboratory at all times.\n",
      "\n",
      "For their part, Williams and Wilmore have repeatedly said they enjoy their time in space.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is my happy place,” Williams said in September. “I love being up here in space. It’s just fun. You know, every day you do something that’s work — quote, unquote — you can do it upside down. You can do it sideways, so it adds a little different perspective.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They have also sought to dispel accusations that they were left behind by the previous administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s been the narrative from day one: stranded, abandoned, stuck — and I get it, we both get it,” Wilmore told CNN’s Anderson Cooper last month when asked to respond to Musk’s and Trump’s comments on the mission. “Help us change the narrative, let’s change it to: prepared and committed despite what you’ve been hearing. That’s what we prefer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Wilmore added fuel to speculation about Musk’s claims regarding an offer to return the astronauts early during a news conference conducted from the space station on March 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can only say that Mr. Musk, what he says is absolutely factual,” Wilmore said.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he added, “We have no information on that, though whatsoever. What was offered, what was, what was not offered, who was offered to, how that process went, that’s information that we simply don’t have.”\n",

      " — \n",
      "A SpaceX Starship spacecraft, the upper portion of the most powerful launch system ever built, exploded during its eighth test flight Thursday, disrupting air traffic and marking the second consecutive failure for the vehicle this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The uncrewed Starship mission lifted off at 5:30 p.m. CT (6:30 p.m. ET) from SpaceX’s Starbase facility in South Texas, with the spacecraft riding atop a 232-foot-tall (71-meter-tall) Super Heavy rocket booster.\n",
      "\n",
      "After about 2 ½ minutes of firing, the Super Heavy booster separated as planned from the Starship’s upper stage, setting itself up for a successful landing within the “chopstick” arms of “Mechazilla,” or SpaceX’s launch tower near Brownsville, Texas. It’s the third time SpaceX has successfully executed the chopsticks booster catch.\n",
      "\n",
      "But less than 10 minutes into the flight, the Starship craft, which had continued on toward space, began to experience issues. Several of the vehicle’s engines visibly cut out during the livestream, and the ship began to tumble before SpaceX lost contact with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once you lose enough of those center engines, you’re going to lose attitude control,” said Dan Huot, SpaceX communications manager, on the livestream. “And so we did see the ship start to go into a spin, and at this point, we have lost contact with the ship.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The loss of signal occurred at roughly the same point during this mission as with Flight 7 in January, when Starship exploded over populated islands in Turks and Caicos, littering the islands with debris.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has not been confirmed where exactly the vehicle exploded during Thursday’s mission. But the explosion was visible from parts of Florida and over the Caribbean, according to reports from residents of those locations that were shared with CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration halted flights into Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, and Orlando airports Thursday evening for “falling space debris” until 8 p.m. ET.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FAA also temporarily kept flights from departing from Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport and Miami International Airport. Flights leaving those airports were still delayed on average by 30 and 45 minutes, respectively, as of Thursday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve got a lot of measures in place, like debris response areas, where we coordinate very closely with air traffic control,” Huot said on the livestream. “We have a lot of measures put (in place) before we ever launch a rocket to make sure that we’re keeping the public safe. Those worked last time and they’re actively in work right now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "SpaceX shared an update with a few details on the incident several hours after the flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Prior to the end of the ascent burn, an energetic event in the aft portion of Starship resulted in the loss of several Raptor engines,” according to a statement from SpaceX. “This in turn led to a loss of attitude control and ultimately a loss of communications with Starship. Final contact with Starship came approximately 9 minutes and 30 seconds after liftoff.”\n",
      "\n",
      "SpaceX said that Starship flew within a designated launch corridor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Any surviving debris would have fallen within the pre-planned Debris Response Area,” according to the statement. “There are no toxic materials present in the debris and no significant impacts expected to occur to marine species or water quality. If you believe you have identified a piece of debris, please contact your local authorities or the SpaceX Debris Hotline at 1-866-623-0234 or at recovery@spacex.com.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the FAA is requiring SpaceX to perform a mishap investigation into the loss of the Starship vehicle, according to a statement released by the agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A mishap investigation is designed to enhance public safety, determine the root cause of the event, and identify corrective actions to avoid it from happening again,” according to the statement. “The FAA will be involved in every step of the SpaceX-led mishap investigation process and must approve SpaceX’s final report, including any corrective actions. A return to flight is based on the FAA determining that any system, process, or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thursday’s launch was SpaceX’s second go at getting Flight 8 off the ground. The company waved off a Monday attempt due to “too many question marks,” according to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Flight 7’s fiery mishap\n",
      "Thursday’s launch occured seven weeks after an explosive mishap prematurely ended Starship’s seventh test flight, raining debris over the islands of Turks and Caicos on January 16.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FAA — which licenses commercial rocket launches — is still overseeing an investigation into the incident, but the agency gave SpaceX the green light February 28 to launch Flight 8. The agency noted that the probe into the Flight 7 mishap was ongoing, but the FAA determined SpaceX had “met all safety, environmental and other licensing requirements for the suborbital test flight,” according to a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its statement to CNN given after the January Flight 7 mishap, the FAA said that it told the Turks and Caicos government that the archipelago was located within a potential hazard area related to the Starship launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agency also said that, before the test flight launched, it required SpaceX to map out “hazard areas sufficient to ensure that the probability of casualty to a member of the public on land or on board a maritime vessel does not exceed one in one million.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No Caribbean islands, including Turks and Caicos, exceeded this threshold,” the agency said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The seventh test flight also exploded less than 10 minutes into flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company believes the root cause was a leak that occurred in the rear section of the vehicle near a tank containing superchilled liquid oxygen, or a form of rocket propellant.\n",
      "\n",
      "While no property damage or injuries were reported, one vehicle was struck on the island of South Caicos, and debris caused brief flight disruptions as air traffic controllers rushed to reroute planes away from the site of the explosion.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, residents of the archipelago of Turks and Caicos told CNN they are still finding debris from the spacecraft littering beaches and roadways. The local government worked with SpaceX to craft a debris recovery plan. However, the contents of the plan have not been made public and it’s not clear who is paying for the cleanup effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither SpaceX nor the Turks and Caicos government responded to requests for comment on the plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Turks and Caicos government account on Instagram shared an advisory to the public Thursday regarding the Flight 8 incident.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We wish to advise the public that this evening’s SpaceX launch appears to have broken up in flight,” the advisory read. “We are in contact with the US FAA, SpaceX and UK agency leads to confirm the position. Post incident protocols have been engaged. The National Security Secretariat will continue to keep the public apprised as we work to ensure the safety and security of our Islands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why these incidents are different\n",
      "SpaceX has long embraced an engineering and development philosophy it calls “rapid iterative development.” The goal has been to rapidly build Starship prototypes and put them on the launchpad with a willingness to blow them up.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s different about the last Starship mission in January and Thursday’s flight is where and how the debris fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the first test flight of Starship and Super Heavy blew up a launchpad at SpaceX’s Starbase facilities in 2023, January’s Flight 7 and Thursday’s Flight 8 both allowed Starship to travel out over the Atlantic and Caribbean before exploding near populated islands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thursday’s mishap raises questions about why the FAA allowed Starship to launch before the agency’s investigation into the Flight 7 mishap was completed — and whether experimental rockets should be allowed to fly over populated areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of upgrades\n",
      "Thursday’s flight test was intended to put Starship through its paces so mission teams could zero in on weak points. Engineers have removed a large number of heat shield tiles from Starship to test vulnerable areas across the spacecraft. The black hexagonal tiles are designed to protect the vehicle as it experiences temperatures exceeding 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit (1,427 degrees Celsius) when reentering Earth’s atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "The failed test flight in January spurred SpaceX to make other upgrades and changes, including new vents and a “purge system” designed to prevent a fire, according to the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "SpaceX said what mission teams learned from the Flight 7 mishap prompted them to alter lines that feed fuel to some of Starship’s engines and tweak propellant temperatures. Another change adjusted the vehicle’s “operating thrust target” — or how much power SpaceX aims for the engines to generate during flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Super Heavy booster has some upgrades of its own, including a more powerful flight computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 17 ½ minutes after lifting off, Starship was planning to attempt to deploy a batch of mock Starlink satellites for the first time. Like the spacecraft, the demo satellites weren’t intended to reach orbit. But similar to the seventh flight test, Flight 8’s objectives were not tested before the incident occurred.\n",

      "Two robotic landers, one from the United States and the other from Japan, are currently in transit toward the moon — and a third has just joined them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest contender is a standout: The spacecraft, called Athena, was built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, which so far is the only private sector company on Earth that has previously made a safe touchdown on the moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lunar lander hitched a ride to orbit atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which took off at 7:16 p.m. ET on Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Athena, on a mission dubbed IM-2, will later aim to make a daring descent toward the moon’s south pole. The region is considered crucial to the modern lunar space race. Scientists suspect it is rich with stores of water ice, a resource that can be converted to breathable air, drinking water or even rocket fuel.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS program, Intuitive Machines’ lander will be equipped with a suite of technology — including a drill, a small robotic “hopper” and a tiny rover — that will allow it to scour the treacherous, crater-riddled terrain and determine whether there is evidence of water.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s very dynamic with a lot of moving parts,” Intuitive Machines cofounder and CEO Steve Altemus said of the mission in an interview earlier this month.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Athena spacecraft, a six-legged lander roughly the size of a telephone booth, will take about a week to reach its destination. The lander will have a truncated trajectory toward the moon compared with the landers that launched last month: Austin, Texas-based Firefly’s Blue Ghost, which is slated to land this weekend, and a lander from Japan-based Ispace, which won’t touch down on the moon before this spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Second moon shot with bigger goals\n",
      "Intuitive Machines made history last year when its first lunar lander, Odysseus — or “Odie,” as it was called by the startup’s employees — made a soft touchdown on the lunar surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Odie succeeded where many others had failed: About half of all lunar landers do not reach their intended destination or crash-land. And before the IM-1 mission, as Odie’s journey was called, only a few nations’ civil space programs had soft-landed spacecraft on the moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the trip wasn’t perfect. A mission-threatening problem arose when Intuitive Machines engineers realized they had not hardwired a rangefinder — or laser designed to measure precise altitude — correctly. That misstep forced the company to rely on an experimental NASA payload that happened to be on board for navigational support.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while Odie safely touched down near the Malapert A crater in the moon’s south pole region, the vehicle broke a leg and landed on its side, tipped over on the edge of a crater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mission teams were able to reconfigure the spacecraft’s communications method in order to retrieve valuable data from onboard science instruments. But the vehicle did not operate as long as Intuitive Machines had expected it would.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the IM-1 mission, Odie sought to test out several navigation technologies and gather scientific data using the NASA science instruments. Odie only had to perch in place as it transmitted data back home.\n",
      "\n",
      "With IM-2, however, the stakes are higher. The Athena lander comes equipped with several smaller robots it will deploy as well as a drill expected to bear down into the moon’s surface, scouring for water ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a much more complex and dynamic and exciting mission,” Altemus said. “It’s one thing to land on the moon. And now we’re down to business on the second attempt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Journey to Mons Mouton\n",
      "After reaching space aboard a Falcon 9 rocket, Athena is set to begin a “a high-energy fastball pitch towards the moon,” as Altemus previously described the trajectory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The journey will include several nail-biting moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Being a steely eyed missile man, I don’t know that we freak out — but there are moments of increased anxiety,” Altemus said. “We’ll see when we go to light the engine the first time that level of anxiety. Everything (has to) come together perfectly to go right, to fire the engine, to put us on our way to the moon. I think that’s the first one where it’s really going to be a knot in our stomach.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point on its trip, Athena will also experience a solar eclipse, as Earth moves in front of the sun and blots out the light.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re going to get degraded power as we fly in the dark with no sun,” Altemus said, “and when that happens, we’ll have to turn off some extra equipment (to conserve power).”\n",
      "\n",
      "The spacecraft will separate from the rocket after reaching what’s called a trans-lunar injection orbit, which is an elliptical path that extends about 236,000 miles (380,000 kilometers) above Earth. Athena will then light its own engines and nudge itself into the moon’s gravitational well.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that milestone, Athena will deploy the smaller spacefaring vehicles that are hitching a ride on board the spacecraft. One is the NASA-made Lunar Trailblazer probe, which seeks to map the distribution of water on the surface as it orbits the moon. Another is a microwave-size spacecraft developed by California-based startup AstroForge that will continue into deep space in the hopes of scouting an asteroid for precious metals.\n",
      "\n",
      "About one week after launching from Florida, Athena will then make its final descent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lander’s destination is Mons Mouton — a plateau near the lunar south pole.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it’s “the closest landing site to the moon’s south pole to date,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, during a February 7 briefing about IM-2’s science objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mons Mouton also offers Athena “the Goldilocks zone for sunlight,” Fox added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though many areas of the lunar south pole are permanently in shadow — the precise locations where water ice may remain perpetually frozen — Mons Mouton offers enough sunlight to “power a roughly 10-day mission while maintaining a clear view to Earth” to allow communication with the spacecraft, Fox said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Athena’s landing site will be “an extremely cold environment that we believe contains volatiles — which are chemical substances that can easily change from a liquid, to a solid, to a gas,” Fox said. “These volatiles may contain trapped water ice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But safely arriving at this destination will be a challenge. The areas closest to the moon’s south pole are pockmarked with impact craters, making it difficult to find a patch of flat, even terrain that’s safe for landing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“IM-2 has to be a lot more accurate than IM-1,” said Intuitive Machines’ navigation lead, Mike Hansen, during a company podcast interview last year. “So, IM-1 we could get away with about a kilometer footprint. IM-2 is down to 50 meters (164 feet).”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What Athena will do\n",

      "NASA’s twin Voyager probes, which launched 47 years ago, are shutting off some science instruments in an effort to conserve power and keep their storied missions going. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are both exploring uncharted territory in interstellar space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, sent a command for Voyager 1 to power down its cosmic ray subsystem experiment on February 25. Meanwhile, Voyager 2’s low-energy charged particle instrument will shut off on March 24. This leaves each probe with three functioning science instruments.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they launched weeks apart in 1977, the Voyager probes carried identical sets of 10 science instruments.\n",
      "\n",
      "But over time, the probes’ power supply has gradually diminished. The Voyager spacecraft rely on electricity generated from the heat of decaying plutonium, and both are losing an estimated 4 watts of power per year.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Voyagers have been deep space rock stars since launch, and we want to keep it that way as long as possible,” said Suzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager at JPL, in a statement. “But electrical power is running low. If we don’t turn off an instrument on each Voyager now, they would probably have only a few more months of power before we would need to declare end of mission.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Investigating uncharted territory\n",
      "Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, originally designed to fly by the largest planets in our solar system, are now the most distant objects made by humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Voyager 1 is more than 15 billion miles (25 billion kilometers) from Earth, while Voyager 2 is over 13 billion miles (21 billion kilometers) away, according to NASA. Both probes are the only spacecraft to operate beyond the heliosphere, the sun’s bubble of magnetic fields and particles that extends well beyond the orbit of Pluto.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instruments necessary for collecting data during the planetary flybys in the 1970s and 1980s were shut off after the probes completed their initial objectives. But the Voyager mission team left the others turned on to collect data about the heliosphere, as well as interstellar space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Voyager 1 crossed into interstellar space, or the space between stars, in 2012, and Voyager 2 did the same in 2018. The probes took different trajectories. Voyager 1 is traveling up away from the plane that includes all of the planets orbiting the sun in our solar system, while Voyager 2 is journeying beneath the plane.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over time, the Voyager team has shut off instruments one by one to ensure the probes probes can continue their storied journeys. In October, NASA shut down Voyager 2’s plasma science instrument. Designed to measure the number of electrically charged atoms in space, the instrument was only returning a limited amount of data in recent years due to its orientation. And Voyager 1’s identical instrument has been shut off for years because its performance degraded over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cosmic ray subsystem shut off on Voyager 1 last week included a trio of telescopes studying and measuring cosmic rays, or the most highly energetic particles in the universe, releasing from the sun and Milky Way galaxy. The Voyager team used data from the instrument to determine exactly when and where Voyager 1 exited the heliosphere and entered interstellar space.\n",
      "\n",
      "The low-energy charged particle instrument that Voyager 2 will power off later this month measures ions, electrons and cosmic rays in the solar system and our galaxy. The subsystems of the instrument include a telescope and magnetospheric particle analyzer, which have a 360-degree view thanks to a rotating platform powered by a stepper motor. The motor was tested to 500,000 steps on Earth, which guaranteed it would operate through Voyager 2’s flyby of Saturn in August 1980. Once it has shut off, the motor will have completed more than 8.5 million steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each probe will still collect unique data, although the team will lose the ability to make identical particle measurements at two different locations in interstellar space, said Linda Spilker, Voyager project scientist at JPL.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having identical instruments aboard the probes allowed scientists to compare the environments the Voyagers have been exploring, noting similarities and differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Voyager spacecraft have far surpassed their original mission to study the outer planets,” said Patrick Koehn, Voyager program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington, in a statement. “Every bit of additional data we have gathered since then is not only valuable bonus science for heliophysics, but also a testament to the exemplary engineering that has gone into the Voyagers — starting nearly 50 years ago and continuing to this day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Voyager probes’ future\n",
      "As the Voyager probes age, the mission’s engineers have become increasingly creative in solving unanticipated problems, including communication blackouts and other glitches, across vast cosmic distances.\n",
      "\n",
      "After turning off the two instruments, both Voyager probes should be able to operate for another year before the team will need to shut off an additional instrument for each spacecraft. The team is already planning to shut off Voyager1’s low-energy charged particle instrument and Voyager 2’s cosmic ray subsystem in 2026.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Voyager 1 and 2 will continue on their journeys with their plasma wave subsystems, which measure waves within plasma fields in space, and magnetometers, measuring changes in magnetic fields, turned on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Both Voyagers will continue to collect unique information on particles such as energetic cosmic rays and interstellar plasma, interstellar magnetic fields and radio waves in the interstellar medium, including any effects from the Sun that propagate to Voyager’s distances,” Spilker said.\n",
      "\n",
      "NASA experts believe the probes will be able to conserve enough power to keep operating with at least one science instrument each into the 2030s, but they are fully aware that any additional challenges that arise could always lead to the end of the line for the Voyager spacecraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Every minute of every day, the Voyagers explore a region where no spacecraft has gone before,” Spilker said. “That also means every day could be our last. But that day could also bring another interstellar revelation. So, we’re pulling out all the stops, doing what we can to make sure Voyagers 1 and 2 continue their trailblazing for the maximum time possible.”\n",

      "\n",
      "If all goes according to plan, Firefly’s lander, called Blue Ghost, will spend about 45 days making a careful approach to its lunar destination around Mons Latreille, an ancient volcanic feature in a more than 300-mile-wide (483-kilometer) basin called Mare Crisium, or the “Sea of Crises,” on the moon’s near side.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mare Crisium was created by early volcanic eruptions and flooded with basaltic lava more than 3 billion years ago,” according to Firefly. “This unique landing site will allow our payload partners to gather critical data about the Moon’s regolith (rock and dust rubble), geophysical characteristics, and the interaction of solar wind and Earth’s magnetic field.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On board Blue Ghost will be a group of science experiments and technology demonstrations, including ones that will test a “Lunar PlanetVac” to collect and sort soil samples on the moon, satellite navigation, radiation-adapated computers, and self-cleaning glass that can wipe away lunar dust, according to Firefly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For its inaugural mission, Blue Ghost is expected to operate on the moon for about 14 days before its landing zone is plunged into the frigid temperatures of lunar nighttime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firefly is among the participants in NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, program in which the space agency partners with private companies to deliver payloads to the moon. Others contractors include Houston-based Intuitive Machines and Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology.\n",

      "\n",
      "“It’s a good time for the lunar economy,” Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CNN in December, adding that he’s “100% confident in our team’s ability” to land the company’s Blue Ghost vehicle successfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Success, of course, is not guaranteed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ispace, the Japan-based company, understands that all too well: The company’s first attempt to put one of its Hakuto-R landers on the moon ended in a dramatic failure in April 2023 because of navigation issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, an upgraded Hakuto-R spacecraft, named Resilience, will offer Ispace a second chance.\n",

      "\n",
      "NASA estimates that the space rock has a 0.0017% chance of hitting Earth in December 2032, while the ESA has a similar risk assessment of 0.002%.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s a 1 in 59,000 possibility of impact, meaning there is a 99.9983% chance that the asteroid will safely zip by Earth in seven years, according to NASA. The agency also shared that the new data suggested that the asteroid had a 1.7% chance of hitting the moon, but those slight odds of impact do not pose a risk to Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When first discovered, asteroid 2024 YR4 had a very small, but notable chance of impacting our planet in 2032,” the agency shared on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As observations of the asteroid continued to be submitted to the Minor Planet Center, experts at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies were able to calculate more precise models of the asteroid’s trajectory and now have found there is no significant potential for this asteroid to impact our planet for the next century. The latest observations have further reduced the uncertainty of its future trajectory, and the range of possible locations the asteroid could be on Dec. 22, 2032, has moved farther away from the Earth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the weekend, the asteroid also dropped to a ranking of 0 out of 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, a tool for categorizing potential collisions of space objects with Earth. The ranking indicates “the likelihood of a collision is zero, or is so low as to be effectively zero. Also applies to small objects such as meteors and bodies that burn up in the atmosphere as well as infrequent meteorite falls that rarely cause damage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Asteroid 2024 YR4, detected by telescopes on December 27, 2024, is estimated to be 131 to 295 feet (40 to 90 meters) wide, comparable to a large building, and could cause local devastation if it were to collide with our planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quick de-escalation of the asteroid’s risk assessment is thanks to “unsung, meticulous work by astronomers” who conducted a steady stream of follow-up observations of the space rock using telescopes across the globe, said Richard Binzel, inventor of the Torino Scale. Binzel is a professor of planetary sciences, joint professor of aerospace engineering and MacVicar Faculty Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m pleasantly surprised that we could reduce the probability numbers so quickly,” Binzel said. “It would not have done anyone any good to have this probability hang around for a long time because it was going to go to zero. The reason I say it was going to go to zero is at the end of the day, the probability is either zero and it misses you, or it’s one and it hits you. Any number in between is just the space of your uncertainty. We didn’t want us to have to sit in that time and space of uncertainty for months and months.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From record-breaking to nonthreatening\n",
      "Early last week, 2024 YR4 briefly broke a record once reached by the asteroid Apophis after it was first spotted in 2004.\n",
      "\n",
      "At its peak threat level, 2024 YR4 reached a 3 on the Torino Scale and had an estimated 3.1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032, according to NASA. The ESA’s observations reached a peak of a 2.8% risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The narrow difference was due to the two agencies’ use of different tools for determining the asteroid’s orbit and modeling its potential impact. But both percentages rose above the 2.7% chance of collision once associated with Apophis, making 2024 YR4 the most significant space rock to be spotted within the past two decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, as with Apophis, astronomers expected the risk for 2024 YR4 to spike and then fall to zero as they obtained more observational data to reduce uncertainties about the asteroid’s path.\n",
      "\n",
      "Measuring 1,148 feet (350 meters) in diameter, Apophis was previously considered one of the most hazardous asteroids, with a chance of hitting our planet and reaching a 4 out of 10 on the Torino Scale. The rating meant that the asteroid merited astronomers’ attention and tracking. Apophis reached a 4 because it was a larger object capable of regional damage, while 2024 YR4 garnered a 3 because it would cause local damage, Binzel said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But like 2024 YR4, Apophis also quickly dropped from a 4 to a 0 on the Torino Scale after astronomers spotted archival observations of the asteroid that more precisely clarified its orbit. While Apophis is still set to make a close flyby of Earth in 2029 that will be studied by multiple spacecraft, it poses no risk to Earth within this century.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest obstacle astronomers face when trying to determine the risk posed by newly discovered asteroids is calculating the unknowns. In the case of 2024 YR4, that includes the space rock’s size as well as its orbit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Observations taken during the dark skies necessary for ground-based telescopes to track faint, small asteroids after February’s full moon, which shone brightly in the night sky on February 12, helped astronomers quickly decrease the risk assessment for 2024 YR4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key telescopes have included the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the Subaru Telescope and Haleakala-Faulkes Telescope North, all located in the Hawaiian Islands, as well as New Mexico’s Magdalena Ridge Observatory, the Gemini South Observatory in the Chilean Andes, Arizona’s Lowell Discovery Telescope and the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The atmosphere above Maunakea tends to be very stable, and it enables telescopes to produce very sharp images, sharper than most other observatory locations,” said David Tholen, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy, in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The likelihood of 2024 YR4’s impact has dropped just in time. Astronomers were concerned because the space rock’s trajectory, carrying it away from Earth in a straight line, meant the asteroid would be out of reach of ground-based telescopes in April and wouldn’t reappear until June 2028.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, astronomers plan to remain vigilant in observing the space rock to ensure that 2024 YR4 poses no risk, and the James Webb Space Telescope is expected to observe the asteroid in early March to pin down more details about its orbit and exact size.\n",

      "While US Olympians have been dominating medal counts and airwaves for decades, their Paralympic colleagues have had far more modest success.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far in the 21st century, the US has only failed to top the Olympic medal table once, but its average place in the Paralympic medals table from 2000 until Paris was fourth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ukraine, a nation with a population around a tenth that of the US and a GDP less than 1% that of the US, has beaten Team USA in two of the last four Paralympic Games.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since coming sixth in the medal table at the 2012 Paralympics in London, there has been a steady improvement in the United States’ position, coming fourth in Rio in 2016 and third in Tokyo in 2021.\n",

      "In the final 2024 medal table, the US finished third – behind China and Great Britain – with 36 gold medals and 105 in total.\n",

      "So, can Team USA continue to turn things around?\n",
      "\n",
      "The US once dominated the Paralympics in the same way it does the Olympic Games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between 1976 and 1996, Team USA topped the medal table at every single Paralympics. The US is the all-time record holder for most overall and gold Paralympic medals, largely due to the nation’s dominance during this period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Julie Dussliere, United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) chief of Paralympics, attributes Team USA’s relative drop in the medals tables to the global growth of the Paralympic movement, told CNN Sport: “Team USA remains incredibly strong and well supported – and we are thrilled by the performance so far in Paris.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One could be forgiven for being unaware of Team USA’s fluctuating fortunes, as the Paralympics have historically struggled to attract TV viewers in numbers anywhere close to the Olympics. In 2000, according to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the Sydney Olympics were watched by a combined TV audience of 3.7 billion. The Sydney Paralympics, however, were seen by a more modest 300 million people – in other words, 92% fewer people saw the Paralympics than the Olympics that year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sparse coverage provided to the Paralympic Games was described by former para athlete and Team USA captain Kristin Duqette as “a disservice to society,” who added: “The reality is, being disabled is a part of being human.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary Hums, a sport administration professor at the University of Louisville who has worked at four Paralympic Games, told CNN Sport that a lack of prominent role models can impact people taking up para sport, and ultimately becoming Paralympians. “If you can’t see one, you don’t think you can be one,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "This sentiment is echoed by Dussliere, who said that US success “helps drive participation and competition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This lack of visibility can delay future elite athletes from beginning their training. Duqette was a five-time American record holder in para swimming but told CNN that she wasn’t aware of the Paralympics until she was 15 years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some international markets, TV audiences for the Paralympics have been provided with more coverage compared to those in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2012, UK broadcaster Channel 4 showed over 400 hours of Paralympics coverage. In the US, however, American rights-holder NBC broadcast just four one-hour highlights packages on cable channel NBC Sports. In response to NBC’s coverage plan, then head of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) Philip Craven, told the Daily Telegraph: “Some people think that North America always lead on everything, and on this they don’t. It’s about time they caught up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Organizers of the Paris Paralympics are promising that the 2024 Games will be the most-watched in Paralympic history, with all sports being broadcast for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "NBC has increased its TV coverage of the Games to over 140 hours split across NBC, USA Network and CNBC, as well as a “record amount of primetime hours,” but this primetime coverage still looks to be confined to three highlights specials. NBC said it is making “an unprecedented commitment to the Paralympics” and will also broadcast around 1,500 hours of coverage on its streaming service Peacock.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UK’s Channel 4, meanwhile, has increased its coverage to 1,300 live hours across TV and free-to-access digital platforms and will broadcast coverage of the Games on its TV channel almost continuously from 8 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. local throughout the duration of the Paralympics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The US is far from the only country to have more limited TV coverage for the Paralympics. In some nations, such as India, the Paralympics will not be shown live on any TV channel.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Future potential athletes have no role models to show them what they are capable of at a time in their lives when most of society is telling them they are incapable of just about anything useful,” Ian Brittain, an academic at Coventry University and an expert in the study of Paralympic sport, told CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sponsors are put off investing because their brand or product won’t get the necessary coverage, however successful the athlete is.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It also reinforces the idea that the Paralympics and therefore Paralympians and/or disabled people are less important and less worthy of attention and acclaim than their non-disabled counterparts, which in turn continues their marginalization and exclusion from the wider society.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to less media coverage of the Paralympics, lack of visibility may also encourage a lack of general interest among audiences. According to Google Trends data, during the 2016 Games there were 60 nations with more search interest in the Paralympics than the US, including Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another major obstacle to US Paralympic dominance is the strength and depth of China’s para athletes squad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Team USA tends to have one of the largest presences in the Olympic Village, with the American delegation in Paris sending 20 more athletes to the Olympics than host nation France. Team USA’s Paralympic representation, however, was smaller, with the nation only sending the fourth-largest group to the City of Light.\n",
      "\n",
      "China, on the other hand, sent the largest number of athletes to the Paris Paralympics – 282 compared to the United States’ 220. The Asian nation’s investment into sporting infrastructure is also a boon; Chinese Paralympians are able to train at the world’s largest training facility for elite athletes with disabilities, as well as at 30 other regional training centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Unless a country is willing to replicate this kind of factory farming of para athletes and invest resources to this degree and beyond – or China decides it no longer wishes to do this – China will continue to dominate for many decades to come,” Brittain told CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, the Asian nation finished top of the medal table in Paris by a large margin with 94 gold medals – slightly less than the United States’ total haul – and 220 total.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are hopes that Los Angeles hosting the Paralympics in 2028 will be an opportunity to fundamentally change attitudes to para sport and disability in general in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "“LA has a history of transformational Games and this is no doubt a huge opportunity to grow Paralympic sport, and reimagine the way the community in LA and across the United States engages,” Dussliere told CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Combined with hosting in Salt Lake in 2034, this decade of sport has the potential to (be) extraordinarily impactful for Paralympic sport in the United States.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hums said China’s improving position in the medal table through the 1990s and 2000s was “consistent with a country hosting an upcoming Games (in 2008).”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sport has the power to inform, it has the power to empower, it has the power to transform,” she said. “Hosting a Games can shine a light on an underlying issue that can then be addressed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Duquette said that hosting the Games will provide the opportunity to show an “organic representation of disability and disabled sports,” which she believes will “break down so many barriers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a 2014 UK government report, almost 70% of the British public believed attitudes towards disabled people had improved since London hosted the 2012 Paralympics.\n",
      "\n",
      "But hosting the Olympics and Paralympics is not a silver bullet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even avid supporters of the Games have acknowledged the difficulties of a singular event to affect society. “It is hard to expect a Games to deliver all the social change that disabled people require to lead equitable lives in the UK,” British Paralympic gold medalist Tanni Grey-Thompson has said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, 12 years after the UK hosted the Paralympics, the UK government was criticized by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) for failing to address “grave and systematic violations of the human rights of persons with disabilities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brittain told CNN that change needs to start “with government and spreading out to everyone else in society. It’s also a long-term process – not something that happens in two weeks in 2028.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He added: “Plans and resources that are co-designed with disabled people need to be put in play now, regularly monitored and evaluated and also resourced for the next 25-30 years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite Team USA not finishing at the top of the medal table in Paris, are we likely to see the US improve even more and claim back the top spot in LA?\n",
      "\n",

      "Two mysterious fast radio bursts originated from wildly different places in space.txt\n",

      " — \n",
      "Mysterious fast radio bursts, or millisecond-long bright flashes of radio waves from space, have intrigued astronomers since the first detection of the phenomenon in 2007. The enigmatic signals, known as FRBs, release as much energy in less than the blink of an eye as the sun emits in one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers are still trying to unravel what the celestial pulses are, as well as how and where they occur. Specialized telescopes have enabled astronomers to track radio bursts within the Milky Way galaxy as well as up to 8 billion light-years away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, four new studies are providing answers about where the fast radio bursts originate, which could shed light on what causes them — but the locations for two recently described radio bursts are wildly different.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the fast radio bursts appears to have come from the chaotic, magnetically active environment near a type of dense neutron star called a magnetar. Meanwhile, the other fast radio burst, which scientists observed pulsating over the course of several months, came from the outskirts of a distant dead, star-starved galaxy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers utilized a fast radio burst-hunting machine called CHIME, or the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment radio telescope, to uncover both bursts. The instrument has enabled the detection of thousands of FRBs since 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The disparate origins of the signals suggest the pulses may come in different flavors and originate in various ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a step closer to unravelling a profound cosmic mystery,” said Ryan Mckinven, an author on all four studies, in a statement. “FRBs are ubiquitous, yet their true nature remains largely unknown. Every discovery we make about their origins opens a new window into the dynamics of the universe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As scientists pin down more details about the varied origins of fast radio bursts, the closer they come to understanding what produces the pulses in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A ‘twinkling’ origin story\n",
      "The telltale quick flash of a fast radio burst named FRB 20221022A captured the attention of an international team of researchers in 2022 when CHIME first detected it. The radio telescope, made up of four large half-pipe-shaped receivers, is located near Penticton, British Columbia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The burst lasted just 2.5 milliseconds and carried the same brightness of other fast radio bursts. But it was notable because the light released by the burst was highly polarized, meaning that the radio waves largely move along a specific trajectory — in this case, traveling in a way that resembled a smooth S-shaped curve.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emission pattern of the radio waves suggested the site that emitted the burst was rotating and reminded the research team of magnetars, or highly magnetized rotating neutron stars that release radio waves. Scientists have long theorized neutron stars, ultradense core remnants left behind after massive stars explode, as origins of fast radio bursts.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the team traced the radio waves, it found the burst originated from a galaxy about 200 million light-years away. The team shared the study results in a report published January 1 in the journal Nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the astronomers wanted to take things a step further by determining the precise location of the radio signal within the galaxy. The findings, published in the same issue of Nature, provide additional support that a neutron star created the fast radio burst.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an attempt to explain how FRBs are formed, scientists have two competing theories.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Popular neutron star origin models can effectively be split into two camps: one where the signal forms within the star’s magnetic environment, and another where it happens much farther out, driven by a shock launched from the star,” said Mckinven, lead author of the study that traced FRB 20221022A to a galaxy, and coauthor of the companion study. He is a doctoral researcher in the department of physics at McGill University in Montreal.\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine which scenario applied to FRB 20221022A, the team looked for scintillation, or the glimmering effect created when the light from a small, bright object, such as a star, filters through a galaxy’s interstellar medium, or gas. The smaller or more distant an object, the more it twinkles, said Dr. Kenzie Nimmo, lead author of the companion study and a Kavli Postdoctoral Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We discovered that this FRB exhibits ‘twinkling,’ similar to how stars appear to twinkle in the night sky,” Nimmo said. “Observing this scintillation indicates that the region where the FRB originated must be incredibly small.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The pattern of the burst’s twinkling suggested it originated close to its source, rather than a larger, more distant region that would belong to a shock wave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nimmo’s team pinpointed the explosion responsible for the burst to the magnetosphere, a magnetically active area about 6,213 miles (10,000 kilometers) away from a rotating neutron star. That is less than the distance between New York and Singapore, the researchers said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zooming in to this small region around a star from 200 million light-years away is “like being able to measure the width of a DNA helix, which is about 2 nanometers wide, on the surface of the moon,” said Kiyoshi Masui, associate professor of physics at MIT, in a statement. Masui was a coauthor of both Nature studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The FRB must have come from the intensely magnetic environment surrounding a neutron star, one of the most extreme environments in the universe,” Nimmo said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The finding is the first time astronomers have determined FRBs can be generated in the immediate vicinity of a neutron star — a celestial object with the strongest known magnetic field. Researchers are still trying to figure out how the burst exploded away from the star’s magnetic field, which is filled with dense plasma, or highly charged gas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Around these highly magnetic neutron stars, also known as magnetars, atoms can’t exist — they would just get torn apart by the magnetic fields,” Masui said. “The exciting thing here is, we find that the energy stored in those magnetic fields, close to the source, is twisting and reconfiguring such that it can be released as radio waves that we can see halfway across the universe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Measuring and analyzing the twinkling of FRBs in the future could be a method astronomers use to better understand FRBs, Nimmo said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bing Zhang, a distinguished professor in the department of physics and astronomy at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, has worked on research that models the origin points of fast radio bursts for years and has seen many observational clues suggesting magnetospheres could be a root cause. Zhang was not involved in any of the new studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“However, the scintillation results presented by Nimmo et al. gave a direct constraint on the scale of the emission region … presenting very convincing evidence that the FRB emission comes from the magnetosphere of a magnetar,” Zhang said in an email.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wen-fai Fong, a member of the CHIME collaboration who was not involved in the two Nature studies, said she believes the research provides “the most robust observational evidence to date demonstrating the emission of an FRB originates close to the neutron star’s surface.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“However we have learned from that the universe likes to surprise us,” said Fong, an associate professor of physics and astronomy at Northwestern University’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, in an email. “We have found a great diversity in the population, and it could be that each one is its own (unique) snowflake.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And that multiplicity is exactly what Fong and her collaborators discovered while studying another fast radio burst.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Signs of life from an ancient galaxy\n",
      "A team of astronomers from the CHIME collaboration, including authors of the two Nature studies, was surprised when a new radio burst, designated FRB 20240209A, flared in February 2024 and proceeded to produce 21 additional pulses through July. The burst is the subject of two complementary studies published Tuesday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six of those pulses were detected by an outrigger telescope 41 miles (66 kilometers) away from CHIME. Outriggers are smaller versions of CHIME that can help astronomers precisely zero in on one specific location where an FRB originates in the night sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team traced the repeating fast radio burst to the edge of an 11.3 billion-year-old galaxy 2 billion light-years from Earth. Then, the researchers used telescopes at the W. M. Keck and Gemini observatories in Hawaii to uncover more details about the ancient, dead galaxy where no new stars are being formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It seems to be the most massive FRB host galaxy to date,” said Tarraneh Eftekhari, lead author of one of the studies, and a NASA Einstein Fellow at Northwestern University’s Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics, or CIERA.\n",
      "“It’s among some of the most massive galaxies out there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But following FRB 20240209A back to its source showed the burst originated from the outskirts of the galaxy where hardly any stars exist, about 130,000 light-years from the galactic center.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Among the FRB population, this FRB is located the furthest from the center of its host galaxy,” said Vishwangi Shah, lead author of the complementary study and a doctoral student of physics at McGill University, in a statement. “This is both surprising and exciting, as FRBs are expected to originate inside galaxies, often in star-forming regions. The location of this FRB so far outside its host galaxy raises questions as to how such energetic events can occur in regions where no new stars are forming.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Before this revelation, scientists have traced only one FRB to the edge of a galaxy. Described in February 2022, the fast radio burst was found within a cluster of stars, called a globular cluster, on the outskirts of galaxy Messier 81, located 12 million light-years from Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fong, who is also a member of CIERA, said she believes FRB 20240209A could be a twin of that event, compelling astronomers to rethink where and how fast radio bursts form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly 100 bursts have been traced back to galaxies, and most were likely caused by magnetars, according to the study authors. Magnetars typically form when gigantic stars explode in a “core collapse” supernova, or when gravity triggers a star to collapse on itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But FRB 20240209A may have come from a dense cluster of stars, where it’s possible that magnetars could form due to the merger of two neutron stars, or a dead white dwarf star collapsing in on itself, the researchers said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team led by Shah has submitted a proposal to use the James Webb Space Telescope for follow-up observations to see whether there is a cluster of stars near where the FRB originated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This discovery tells us that perhaps not all FRBs come from young stars, and that maybe there are multiple ways these signals are produced,” Eftekhari said. “Maybe there’s a subpopulation of these events that are coming from older systems.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Solving one of the universe’s biggest mysteries\n",
      "Understanding that fast radio bursts may have diverse origins is just the tip of the iceberg that could help astronomers understand more about what they deem to be one of the most mysterious phenomena in the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s clear that there’s still a lot of exciting discovery space when it comes to FRBs, and that their environments could hold the key to unlocking their secrets,” Eftekhari said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upgrades to FRB detection technology and the addition of outrigger telescopes will enable the detection and tracing of even more bursts in the future, which could potentially reveal patterns and help determine whether repeating flashes occur in specific types of galaxies, Eftekhari said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new research sheds more light on what causes fast radio bursts and where they occur, Zhang said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ‘how’ question is more difficult and needs a lot more work from theorists to tackle it,” he said.\n",

      "NASA’s two-for-one launch of its newest space telescope, SPHEREx — designed to seek out the key ingredients for life in the Milky Way — alongside a sun-focused mission called PUNCH is facing another delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both missions were expected to lift off together aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 11:10 p.m. ET (8:10 PT) Monday from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. But weather conditions were only 20% favorable for a launch, and mission teams from NASA and SpaceX decided to stand down from the attempt, the space agency said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are opportunities to take off available through April, and NASA and SpaceX will share a new date when conditions have improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The launch window originally opened on February 28. But weather and a series of integration issues cropped up as engineers attached both missions to the rocket and encapsulated them within a protective faring, which delayed the proceedings, said Julianna Scheiman, director of NASA Science Missions at SpaceX. NASA and SpaceX also scrubbed a launch attempt Saturday night to “allow teams to continue rocket checkouts ahead of liftoff,” according to the agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the missions have entirely different goals, launching PUNCH as a secondary rideshare along with SPHEREx helps get “more science into space for less cost,” said Dr. Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. And it helps that the missions are going to a similar place: a sun-synchronous orbit around Earth’s poles, meaning each spacecraft keeps the same orientation relative to the sun throughout the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "SPHEREx, or the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer, aims to shed light on how the universe has evolved and find where life’s key ingredients originated in the cosmos.\n",
      "\n",
      "PUNCH, or Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere, will study how the sun affects the solar system. The mission will observe the sun’s hot outer atmosphere, called the corona, and study solar wind, or the energized particles that emerge in a steady stream from the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both groundbreaking missions promise to reveal previously unseen and unknown aspects of our solar system and galaxy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These missions cover the full breadth of the science that NASA does every day,” said Dr. Mark Clampin, acting deputy associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “PUNCH … will study the sun in great detail, whereas SPHEREx is a survey mission that will scan the full sky and will observe hundreds of millions of stars. So every minute of the day, NASA science missions are exploring the universe at different scales to really help us understand the universe we live in and understand the sun that keeps our planet alive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The star stuff of life\n",
      "After launching, SPHEREx will spend just over two years orbiting Earth from 404 miles (650 kilometers) overhead, collecting data on more than 450 million galaxies. The telescope also will survey more than 100 million stars in our galaxy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mapping the distribution of the galaxies will help scientists to understand a cosmic phenomenon called inflation, or what sparked the universe to increase in size by a trillion-trillionfold nearly instantaneously after the big bang.\n",
      "\n",
      "The observatory will create a map of the sky in 102 colors of infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye and ideal for studying stars and galaxies. The telescope will split infrared light into individual wavelengths, like a prism. The different colors of light can help scientists uncover the composition of celestial objects by isolating their chemical compounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are the first mission to look at the whole sky in so many colors,” said Jamie Bock, SPHEREx principal investigator at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology, both in Pasadena, California, in a statement. “Whenever astronomers look at the sky in a new way, we can expect discoveries.”\n",
      "\n",
      "SPHEREx will also measure the total glow of light emitted by all galaxies, including those that are too distant and faint to be detected by other telescopes, to provide a broad look at all the major sources of light across the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of SPHEREx’s main goals is to search for evidence of water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and other ingredients necessary for life frozen within the clouds of gas and dust that give rise to planets and stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, astronomers are eager to look inside molecular clouds, or giant regions full of gas and dust, that may contain newly formed stars. It’s likely that these stars will be ringed by disks of material, which form planets. Astronomers believe ice connected to small dust grains is where most of the water in the universe can be found — and is likely where the water that created Earth’s oceans originated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinpointing the ingredients for life across our galaxy, and their abundance, will enable researchers to determine how they could be incorporated into newly forming planets.\n",
      "\n",
      "SPHEREx will act like a partner for the James Webb Space Telescope. While Webb is a targeted telescope, meaning it observes a small area but in greater detail, SPHEREx is a survey telescope that observes large portions of the sky quickly. Combining the data from both telescopes can connect fine details with the bigger picture. If SPHEREx spots something of interest, then Webb or the Hubble Space Telescope can zoom in on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Packing a punch\n",
      "PUNCH is a constellation of four small suitcase-size spacecraft that will spend the next two years whirling around Earth to observe the sun and the heliosphere, or the sun’s bubble of magnetic fields and particles that extends well beyond the orbit of Pluto.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each satellite carries a camera, which acts like a synchronized, single, virtual instrument with a largely uninterrupted view of the sun. The cameras are equipped with polarizing filters, similar to polarized sunglasses, that enable them to make maps of features in the corona and across the solar system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, the four satellites will create global, 3D observations of where the sun’s outer atmosphere transitions to become the solar wind to help scientists understand how this process occurs. PUNCH will also glimpse how the corona and solar wind affect the rest of the solar system. It will be the first mission to image the corona and solar wind together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solar wind, as well as solar storms, are responsible for space weather that can affect Earth, creating beautiful auroras near the poles but also interfering with communications satellites and triggering outages of power grids. Measurements collected by PUNCH will help scientists better understand how solar storms form and evolve, which could lead to accurate predictions for when space weather could impact Earth. PUNCH will be observing the sun at a crucial time during solar maximum, or the peak of the sun’s activity during its 11-year cycle, when more flares and solar storms are expected to occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What we hope PUNCH will bring to humanity is the ability to really see, for the first time, where we live inside the solar wind itself,” said Craig DeForest, principal investigator for PUNCH at Southwest Research Institute’s Solar System Science and Exploration Division in Boulder, Colorado, in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like SPHEREx and the Webb telescope, PUNCH will be able to work in tandem with NASA’s Parker Solar Probe, which launched in 2018 and recently made its closest pass to the sun, to capture the bigger picture as well as close-up details.\n",
      "\n",
      "“PUNCH is the latest heliophysics addition to the NASA fleet that delivers groundbreaking science every second of every day,” said Joe Westlake, director of NASA’s heliophysics division, in a statement. “Launching this mission as a rideshare bolsters its value to the nation by optimizing every pound of launch capacity to maximize the scientific return for the cost of a single launch.”\n",

      "For Shannon Rowbury, it was simultaneously one of the best and worst moments of her running career.\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of her was thrilled and exhilarated to be competing in the finals of a second Olympic Games, and the roar of the crowd was like nothing she had experienced before – so loud that it seemed as though the ground was trembling inside the London Stadium.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rowbury describes it as “the most out-of-body experience I’ve had in my entire life,” the noise only growing louder as she and her other competitors neared the finish line.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for all the absorbing spectacle, the race also had dark secret, an underbelly of corruption owing to a raft of doping violations that would emerge over time. Today, the women’s 1,500-meter final at the London 2012 Olympics is considered one of the dirtiest races in the history of track and field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the 13 athletes in the field, five are set to have had their results disqualified for doping violations. That includes Aslı Çakır Alptekin and Gamze Bulut, the two Turkish runners who were first and second across the line, and, most recently, Russian Tatyana Tomashova, who was moved up to the silver medal position after initially placing fourth.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s for these reasons that Rowbury has mixed feelings about the race; only now, more than a decade on, can she begin to look at the experience in a more positive light.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Dream come true’\n",
      "Earlier this month, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) handed Tomashova a 10-year doping ban after samples she returned in June and July 2012 retested as positive for anabolic steroids – despite her arguing during a trial that she had never taken prohibited substances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tomashova’s results between June 2012 and January 2015 are also set to be disqualified, and she has until October 3 to appeal the decision. CNN has contacted Tomashova’s legal representatives for further comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rowbury, having initially finished sixth at the Olympics, is now in line to be promoted to the bronze medal position – more than 12 years after the race. It would also make her the first American woman to win a 1,500m track medal at the Olympics, even if that accolade is only being recognized more than a decade after the fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she first read the media statement from CAS, Rowbury says that she “just started shaking,” then bawled into her husband’s arms in what she calls a “release of 12 years of pain” and a “dream come true.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Athletes in our position are very much in the dark,” she tells CNN Sport. “It’s super emotional because you’re hopeful that, after this thing that you have sort of suspected for so long, justice might actually be coming … After 12 years, I had kind of given up hope that it would ever happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The most heartbreaking part’\n",
      "Rowbury’s professional career came to an end in 2018, around the time that she became pregnant with her daughter. She competed at five world championships – winning bronze in the 1,500m in 2009 – and at three Olympics: Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the challenges she faced in her career, it was the notion that some of her rivals had been doping that troubled her the most.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I just couldn’t make peace with it,” says Rowbury. “I haven’t cried too often, but there have been a few things that have really struck a nerve … We were competing in a time that was unfortunately so dirty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s just been the most heartbreaking part,” she adds. “It was the thing that broke me about running, the doping in sport … In these races, it’s not just physical, it’s like we give, at least for me, the depth of my being, my soul. I’m trying to give everything I can to bring home that result that will make everyone proud.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The amount of energy she was expending on her career, compounded by the fact that some of her fellow competitors were doping, meant that professional running was often a painful space for Rowbury to navigate.\n",
      "\n",
      "After retiring, she says that she couldn’t even watch the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, such was her sense of disillusionment with the sport. She worked as an analyst for NBC during this year’s Games in Paris but was still plagued by a lingering sense of regret.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was bittersweet because I watched these races and I was thrilled that it seemed like it was a cleaner slate,” says Rowbury. “But I was also heartbroken again that I was a decade too early to be able to be a part of that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The 40-year-old is not alone in her plight. Her US teammate, Alysia Montaño, also discovered this year that, having originally placed fifth in the 800 meters, she is now set to receive a bronze medal from the London Olympics due to doping violations by rivals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rowbury becomes most emotional when she considers how differently her career might have gone if she had been recognized as an Olympic medalist at the time – the additional money and endorsement deals she might otherwise have earned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think I have the strength to really dig into it yet,” she says to CNN, adding, “I never wanted to sound bitter, I never wanted to sound jaded by it, so I just sort of buried it. I’m grateful to be able to kind of start unpacking all this for a positive reason.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A California-native, Rowbury has entertained the prospect of receiving her bronze medal at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, with her family and friends there to witness the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s a part of me that thinks that that would be a really incredible kind of closure to this crazy journey,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are more running goals on the horizon, too. Rowbury is racing her first marathon in New York on November 3, and training for that has helped to readjust her relationship with the sport.\n",
      "\n",
      "With her days as a full-time athlete behind her, she says that she still “deeply loves the sport of running” – the sense of community at local clubs and the buzz of energy at big races. Now, she is learning to appreciate those things in ways that didn’t seem possible when she was a professional athlete.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had kind of cut out all of the fun by the end, it felt like,” says Rowbury. “But the process of finding runs as a time for me in the day to clear my head, to connect to my body, and then connect with the community – it’s been really healing.”\n",

And the latest mission of the nearly 400-foot-tall (121-meter) vehicle is designed to push the envelope even further in a quest to return astronauts to the moon and someday fulfill CEO Elon Musk’s dream of sending the first humans to Mars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liftoff is now on track for no earlier than 5 p.m. ET (4 p.m. local time) Thursday from SpaceX’s launchpad at its Starbase facility near Brownsville, Texas. The window for launch will remain open for one hour. The company will livestream the event on its website and X.\n",

      "The imminent flight will test an upgrade of Starship that aims to improve the vehicle’s capabilities — and ability to survive the trip home from space — as well as carry out an experimental maneuver designed to test how satellites might deploy from this “new generation” of the spaceship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially scheduled to launch on Wednesday, SpaceX is now targeting Thursday due to weather, the company shared on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk purchased in 2022. Thursday is also when Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is set to make a second attempt to get its New Glenn rocket off the ground for its maiden flight. Blue Origin is seeking to use New Glenn to better compete with SpaceX, which has dominated the global launch market for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Super Heavy rocket booster, the vehicle’s bottommost portion known as the first stage, gives the initial thrust after takeoff. The booster will fire its 33 Raptor engines for about 2 ½ minutes to propel the attached uncrewed Starship vehicle away from the launchpad toward space.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time, one of those 33 Raptor engines will have been to space before: SpaceX said it is reusing an engine recovered from the Super Heavy booster flown during the company’s fifth test flight in October.\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing out the ability of the Raptor engines to fly multiple missions is key for SpaceX: The company intends to reuse every portion of the Starship system in order to drive down costs as well as cut down on the time between missions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The highly anticipated launch will mark the seventh flight of the fully integrated Starship system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Will Super Heavy booster repeat midair landing maneuver?\n",
      "After burning through most of its fuel, the Super Heavy booster will then detach from the Starship spacecraft, which will ignite its own engines and begin soaring through space.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gargantuan booster will steer itself back toward the launch site and attempt a soft touchdown, landing precisely between two massive metal pincers, or “chopsticks,” attached to SpaceX’s launch tower, nicknamed “Mechazilla” by CEO Elon Musk.\n",
      "\n",
      "SpaceX pulled off the maneuver for the first time in October. During the next test flight in November, however, it aborted a Super Heavy touchdown attempt on terra firma after sensors at the landing zone were damaged during the initial launch. Engineers found “critical hardware” did not pass a health check.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, the Super Heavy booster splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico and was not recovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the upcoming trial, SpaceX will once again have the option to switch paths midflight and execute an ocean splashdown of the booster if safety issues arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "But SpaceX indicated its hopes are higher, noting in a blog post that hardware “upgrades to the launch and catch tower will increase reliability for booster catch.” The upgrades include better protection for sensors on Mechazilla that failed during the November test flight and triggered the company to divert to an ocean landing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A next-generation spaceship\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Starship spacecraft, or the rocket’s upper stage that’s designed to carry satellites or humans, will test a suite of upgrades the company has made.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spaceship’s propulsion system, for example, has been altered to increase the propellant volume by 25%. The ability to hold more fuel allows the craft to fire its engines for a longer duration. Prior to this test flight, the Starship spacecraft could hold about 1,200 metric tons (2.6 million pounds) of oxidizer and fuel, the company previously said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a big first, Starship will also attempt to deploy 10 satellite “simulators,” SpaceX said, that will be “similar in size and weight” to the company’s next generation of Starlink internet satellites. The simulators will not stay in space, the company noted. Instead, they will travel on a suborbital path, much like the Starship spacecraft, which is slated to splash down in the Indian Ocean about one hour after takeoff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before this particular spacecraft reaches its watery demise, however, SpaceX will test a few other key objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Starship vehicle is in space, SpaceX will attempt to reignite one of its engines — testing out how the spacecraft might light up its propulsion system more than once on future missions that require more than one engine burn. The company tested relighting a Starship engine during the November test flight, deeming that trial a success.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this seventh flight test of the integrated rocket system, SpaceX has made changes to Starship that include adjustments to the vehicle’s flaps, or the winglike structures jutting out from the tip of the spacecraft. For this mission, the flaps are smaller and shifted further toward the tip of the vehicle, according to SpaceX.\n",
      "\n",
      "This tweak is designed to reduce the strain on the flaps during reentry, or the portion of the flight during which Starship begins to plunge back into Earth’s atmosphere while still traveling thousands of miles per hour, according to SpaceX. The maneuver can heat up Starship’s exterior to more than 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit (1,427 degrees Celsius), according to prior flight data, and has previously charred Starship’s flaps into “skeleton hands,” as Musk put it, under the jarring physics of reentry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The road ahead\n",
      "Since test launches of the Starship system began in April 2023, SpaceX has witnessed the Starship vehicle go from exploding minutes after liftoff to polished flights ending that conclude with the vehicle making controlled landings in the ocean. The successful landing of a Super Heavy booster at its launchpad using the “chopstick” catch maneuver in October also marked a monumental step forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Starship system still has a long way to go before it can return humans to the moon’s surface or take the first humans to Mars.\n",
      "\n",
      "SpaceX has yet to conduct a mission to orbit or test out how Starship will rendezvous with another vehicle for refueling in space, a maneuver the company must perfect to supply the vehicle with enough fuel to get to the moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk said in 2020 that he hopes SpaceX will launch “hundreds of missions” with satellites before attempting a crewed Starship flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "As indicated by Starlink simulators on this latest flight, the company plans to use Starship to deploy batches of its internet-beaming satellites in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company also aims to hash out how to land and refly the Starship spacecraft — rather than losing it to an ocean splashdown without recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar to the Super Heavy booster, this upper portion of the vehicle is intended to land upright in the arms of the Mechazilla launch tower after flight so that it can be rapidly reused.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the broadcast of SpaceX’s November test launch, SpaceX engineers Jessie Anderson and Kate Tice said the company was finishing construction of the 1 million-square-foot (92,903-square-meter) “Starfactory” at its Starbase facility in South Texas. The goal for that unit is to manufacture Starship vehicles — “hundreds of ships per year,” Anderson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "SpaceX envisions it will need a large fleet of Super Heavy boosters — and an even larger stable of Starship spacecraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s because the Starship vehicles “will be staying in space for long duration missions to go to the moon or Mars or become tankers for refueling,” Anderson said. “But the boosters will come back and turn around to launch the next ship.”\n",

      "“That (production cadence) might sound crazy,” Tice noted. “And that’s because it is.”\n",

      "The lawmakers appeared frustrated by the brief reply they received to their February 6 letter to Petro. NASA’s response, which is dated February 13, was obtained by CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Signed by Marc Hone, NASA’s acting associate administrator for the agency’s Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, the February 13 note revealed that “DOGE has identified an individual who will be employed by NASA.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Hone did not name the individual, nor did he respond to representatives’ questions in the February 6 letter about how the space agency would ensure DOGE personnel did not gain access to or share data in a compromising way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather, Hone said in his letter that the DOGE representative at NASA “will have all necessary access to NASA owned or managed resources as required for his duties, in compliance with all laws and regulations regarding the protection of IT resources and classified information,” adding that NASA intends to comply with all executive orders from the Trump administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawmakers’ new letter states that NASA had “no legitimate rationale” not to disclose the name of the DOGE representative and said the space agency’s February 13 response “raises more questions than it provides answers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They also questioned Hone’s remarks about granting DOGE access to NASA resources, wondering if that was “an admission that (the DOGE employee) will have unrestricted access to proprietary data.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If true, this would be a highly disturbing admission,” the letter states. “The agency’s ambiguity on this issue must end immediately.”\n",

      "NASA provided the following statement to CNN: “The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) sets strict requirements to ensure ethical conduct across federal agencies. NASA faithfully implements OGE’s requirements, applying them to all employees, to address conflicts of interest. All federal employees working with NASA, to include employees supporting Department of Government Efficiency activities, must comply with OGE’s requirements,” a spokesperson for the space agency said via email.\n",

      "The House members are also seeking clarity about what NASA’s DOGE representative will be doing, stating that “we do not know what this individual’s job will be.” The letter said that the DOGE agent “should be fully prepared to discuss his hiring, mandate, agenda, and activities with our staff and the staff of the (Republican) Majority as well” in a meeting to take place no later than March 14.\n",

      "The United States has extended its lead over other nations as the world’s biggest exporter of weapons, with Europe now its main customer. The US accounted for 43% of global weapons exports between 2020 and 2024, more than four times the share of France, the world’s second-largest exporter, according to new data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). That’s up from a 35% share commanded by America between 2015 and 2019, the think tank said in a report published Monday. Europe has grown increasingly reliant on US-made weapons over the past decade, the report also showed. In the past five years — which cover Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine on the European Union’s doorstep — American-made weapons accounted for almost two-thirds of the arms imported by European members of NATO, up from just over half between 2015 and 2019. For the first time in two decades, according to SIPRI, the majority of US arms exports went to the broader European region rather than the Middle East. Ukraine has imported vast quantities of weapons and military equipment, including from the US, since Russia’s full-scale invasion. The data highlights Europe’s two-pronged dependency on America for its security: it has been relying on US-made weapons, as well as on promises of US military help in any potential future war. But that reality is changing. Last month, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth urged Europe to take “responsibility” for its own security. The US remains committed to the NATO alliance, he said, but will “no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency.” Distancing itself even further from Europe, the Trump administration then held talks with Moscow to explore ending the war in Ukraine — without inviting officials from either the European Union (EU) or Ukraine. Europe is now preparing to spend big to expand its own weapons production. EU nations spent about 1.9% of their combined gross domestic product on defense last year but there have been recent calls from within Europe and the US for much more. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte recently argued that European military spending should be “north of 3%.” On Thursday, all 27 members of the EU greenlit proposals that could make billions of euros available for defense spending. EU leaders discussed a proposal from the head of the bloc’s executive that would provide countries with loans totaling up to €150 billion ($163 billion) and said the plan would be studied ahead of another meeting at the end of the month.  \n",

      "Last week, President Trump threatened to impose a jumbo 200% tariff on all wine, Champagne and other alcoholic products from the European Union, writing on social media: “This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.” But many winemakers and grape growers in California, which has the lion’s share of US wine production, view the proposal with a sense of unease. While some are cautiously optimistic the tariffs could revive interest in California-made wines, others worry tariffs threaten to upend a fragile industry already contending with faltering demand and crop destruction from recent wildfires and droughts in the state. “Even though we’re a farming family business, there’s a global link,” said John Williams, the founder of Frog’s Leap, a winery in California’s Napa Valley. “This is not good for our industry in general.” Alcoholic beverages are one of the EU’s top exports to the United States, according to EU data. Tariffs would almost certainly make European wine and other alcoholic beverages cost more for the average American ordering wine from a restaurant or shopping in their local liquor store. Trump’s 200% tariff proposal marks one more escalation in the growing trade spat between the two sides. Trump has also imposed a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum, including imports from the EU. In response, the EU announced countermeasures, including a 50% tariff on American whiskey, that will roll out in April. Williams, who has been in the wine business for 45 years, said he feared tit-for-tat tariffs would hurt wine distributors — the middlemen who purchase wine directly from producers and sell it to retailers and restaurants. “We all rely on the same distributors. The health of those businesses is important to wineries all over the world,” he said. Williams’ business also exports wine to Canada, another country embroiled in trade conflict with the United States. As tensions between the neighboring countries have escalated in recent weeks, some stores have pulled American alcohol brands off the shelves. “We need to sell all the cases we can,” Williams said. “We don’t need business interruption right now.” Benefit to big producers? Overall, demand for wine has been in decline as Baby Boomers get older and make way for younger generations who consume less alcohol, according to a recent report from Silicon Valley Bank. The report estimated that total wine category sales would have negative volume growth of between minus 3% and minus 1% in 2024. That decline in demand has especially hurt smaller family-owned wineries and farms in California, said John Duarte, a former Republican Congressman who runs a family farm and grape vine nursery. Larger alcohol corporations that both import and export wine won’t suffer as much from a tariff on EU wines as smaller businesses, Duarte said. That’s because US Customs and Border Protection offers refunds of certain duties, taxes and fees paid on imported items, so long as a company exports similar items. Duarte said the tariffs may have the unintended effect of encouraging large alcohol brands to import more European alcohol, at a higher price, in order to maximize the refunds they get when exporting similar items. “At first, you want to be thankful that President Trump is standing up for the domestic wine industry. That should be a good thing,” Duarte said. “But this 200% tariff on top of other excise and tariffs that are in place already is a giant advantage to the global wine companies that do importing and exporting from the United States.” Duarte said that while he agrees that some trade between the United States and EU is unfair, the solution needs to be handled “much more carefully.” Silver lining for some wine producers Not all winemakers in California believe Trump’s tariffs will be a net negative on business, though. Bruce Lundquist, the co-founder of Rack & Riddle, the largest sparkling wine producer in the United States, is hopeful the tariffs would raise interest in his company’s product. In 2023, France shipped almost 27 million bottles of Champagne to the United States, making it the top destination for exports of the sparkling beverage, according to Comité Champagne, an industry trade association. But a 200% tariff on Champagne imports — and the price hike that would likely go along with it — would be a “devastating blow” to that market, said Lundquist. “Nobody wants a trade war. I don’t know if that’s in anybody’s best interest,” Lundquist said. “But it would probably boost business for domestically made sparkling wines.” “Most of these operations are relatively small, usually family-owned and employ a lot of people in their communities,” he added. “It would certainly be refreshing for American consumers to refocus on the wine products produced here in the United States.”  \n",

      "Columbia University has announced a series of new policies, including restrictions on demonstrations, new disciplinary procedures and immediately reviewing its Middle East curriculum, making apparent concessions following President Trump’s revocation of $400 million in federal funding over campus protests. The Trump administration demanded several changes, including the university enforcing its disciplinary policies, implement rules for protests, ban masks, announce a plan to hold student groups accountable, empower its law enforcement, review its Middle East studies programs and its admissions. President Donald Trump has been threatening to cut federal money to colleges accused of tolerating antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war that began in October 2023. Columbia was the first to see its funding slashed. The last academic year saw widespread campus unrest, including pro-Palestinian protests and encampments, counterprotests, building takeovers, arrests and scaled-back graduation ceremonies. Columbia became the epicenter of the nationwide demonstrations. The university’s plans appear intended to address the complaints. Whether the university’s plans will lead to the release of the $400 million in funding is unclear. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. Here are the main takeaways from the university’s announcement:\n",

      "A Cornell graduate student who has been a prominent voice at pro-Palestinian protests – and who faced intense criticism for declaring “glory to the resistance!” after the Hamas attack on Israel that left more than 1,200 dead – is being told to surrender to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a new court filing made shortly after he asked a judge to preemptively order the government not to deport him. Momodou Taal, a doctoral candidate in Africana Studies who is a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and The Gambia and who has twice been suspended by Cornell for alleged disruptive protest activities, said the government was likely preparing to expel him as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to target what they have called antisemitic speech on college campuses. In an email sent to Taal’s attorneys at 12:52 a.m. Friday, a Justice Department lawyer wrote, “ICE invites Mr. Taal and his counsel to appear in-person at the (Homeland Security Investigations) Office in Syracuse at a mutually agreeable time for personal service of the (Notice to Appear) and for Mr. Taal to surrender to ICE custody.” A Notice to Appear is one of the first steps in the formal process of deportation. The email did not specify a deadline for Taal to surrender. “We don’t even know if that notice to appear actually exists. If it did, we think that the Justice Department would have provided us with a copy of it,” Lee said. “It is not yet clear what grounds for removal the government alleges exist here,” Lee said in a filing Friday before federal judge Elizabeth C. Coombe, a Biden appointee. “He lives in constant fear that he may be arrested by immigration officials or police as a result of his speech,” Taal’s attorneys said in a lawsuit filed last weekend, asking a federal judge in New York to strike down two executive orders targeting universities and “foreign national” protesters. The government has not yet filed a formal response to the federal complaint. CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and attorneys representing the Trump administration in the lawsuit for comment and has not yet received a response. Taal’s attorney said the Trump administration responded to Taal’s lawsuit “by sending agents to stake out his house.” “When we asked the Court to enjoin the administration from detaining Mr. Taal as the case progresses, the administration responded by ordering him to surrender to ICE. This does not happen in a democracy,” said Lee in a statement to CNN. “We are outraged, and every American should be too.” In addition to Taal, the lawsuit’s plaintiffs include a fellow doctoral candidate and a professor at Cornell who are both US citizens, but say their First Amendment rights have been chilled by the threat of prosecution for protests against Israeli policies. “This lawsuit is a necessary step to preserve our most fundamental constitutional protections,” wrote Abed Ayoub, national executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, which is assisting in the lawsuit. “The First Amendment guarantees the freedom of speech and expression to all persons within the United States, without exception.” Coombe did not immediately rule on the motion for a temporary restraining order blocking Taal’s deportation, but ordered the government to respond to the request by 5 p.m. Saturday. Taal’s attorneys will need to file a reply brief addressing any arguments made by the government, which is due by 5 p.m. on Sunday. A hearing is scheduled for 2 p.m. on Tuesday in Syracuse, where Coombe will hear the arguments and issue a ruling “in the time it takes them to render it,” according to Lee. Taal’s efforts to fight potential deportation come only two weeks after Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian protest leader Mahmoud Khalil was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A judge has blocked efforts to expel him from the country, but it was the first prominent move in a series of immigration actions aimed at college students and faculty.  \n",

      "Maribel Gardea spent years trying to convince Texas’ San Antonio Public Schools that her 14-year-old son, who has cerebral palsy and is non-verbal, needed an eye gaze device in the classroom. She sat in many meetings with staff members, including the district’s technology expert, pleading for the device that would allow her son to communicate through eye movements instead of using a mouse or keyboard. The district remained unconvinced until she invoked the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, known as IDEA, she said. The federal law, enforced by the US Department of Education, guarantees free public education for disabled children and protects Individualized Education Programs, which are tailored to their unique needs. Last year, the district finally purchased the eye gaze device, she said, and staff began working closely with her son as he used it. On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order kicking off the process of eliminating the Department of Education – a move that could have potential consequences for parents like Gardea. While entirely shuttering the department would require an act of Congress, the president directed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities,” the executive order reads. “The experiment of controlling American education through Federal programs and dollars — and the unaccountable bureaucracy those programs and dollars support — has plainly failed our children, our teachers, and our families.” The Department of Education provides more than $15 billion annually to help serve 7.4 million students through the IDEA. A day after signing the executive order, Trump announced the Small Business Administration would take over the department’s student loan portfolio, while the Department of Health and Human Services would handle special needs and nutrition programs. Gardea worries that if the Department of Education closes, parents of disabled children will lose federal funds and protection and enforcement of their educational needs. It’s a fear parents of children with special needs across the country have expressed since the Department of Education announced last week it was cutting its workforce by nearly 50%. The staff reductions are the first step in shutting down the 46-year-old agency, McMahon has said. Gardea called the move to close the department, “disheartening.” “It really says a lot about our country,” Gardea said. “It says a lot about how we care for our children no matter their race, what their limitations are, what their disabilities are and how this isn’t a priority for our president.” Concerned teachers Neas said the Department of Education also plays a role in training special education teachers and provides guidance to schools on innovative methods for teaching disabled children. “I think this is such a bad idea,” Neas said of the plan to shutter the agency. “Education is really a core function in our country. And our workforce depends on educated students.” The Department of Education helps ensure equality for all school children regardless of their race or disability, said David Johns, CEO and executive director of the National Black Justice Collective. With the downsizing and looming closure of the agency, more students will “have their disabilities undiagnosed and as a result of that unmet,” he said. “We should expect the assurances that have been provided to students and families to no longer exist,” Johns said. He said he hopes the civil rights and faith communities can come together to support disabled families when they are being underserved by school districts and states. “We are equipped to make a way,” Johns said. Special education teachers are also concerned about how their classrooms will be impacted. Jennifer Graves, a special education teacher and executive vice president of the New Haven Federation of Teachers in Connecticut, said the Department of Education helps fund many special accommodations for disabled students, such as paraprofessionals, assistive technology, and accessible playground equipment for children in wheelchairs. Graves said school districts would have to compensate for the potential loss of federal funding, which could only delay the process of getting services to students. “Parents are going to get frustrated, and we might see more legal matters,” Graves said. “Because students aren’t going to be receiving the services they need in an appropriate amount of time.”  \n",

      "The Trump administration’s attempt this month to deport a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian campus activist due to his alleged “activities aligned to Hamas” was the first case of its kind to grab headlines. Since then, two foreign-born academics with visas to work at other prominent US universities – Georgetown and Brown – have been detained or deported over homeland security concerns. Another Columbia student and Fulbright scholar left the country after she was told she faced immigration action as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on international students who participated in protests against the Israel-Hamas war, which flared again this week as a ceasefire that Trump’s envoy had been working to extend fell apart. At least two of the recent high-profile cases involve an obscure federal statute that gives the secretary of state authority to act upon the belief a non-citizen “would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States,” the Department of Homeland Security has said. The Trump administration also is using the agency’s intelligence to identify international students at dozens of US campuses who participated in last year’s war demonstrations. “This is the first arrest of many to come,” Trump posted March 10 about Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil’s case. “We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it.” Trump’s Department of Education also is investigating 60 universities – including six of eight in the Ivy League – for “antisemitic harassment and discrimination.” The administration’s effort to delegitimize the role of universities is not a new idea. It follows decades of private and public talk among conservatives about weakening the institutions. And the pressure now focused on higher education in particular has a familiar ring to Steven Levitsky, a professor of government and Latin American studies at Harvard University and a coauthor of “How Democracies Die.” “It is really common for authoritarian governments – both those on the left and those on the right – to go after universities,” said Levitsky. “It’s difficult to find an autocrat from Hugo Chávez (in Venezuela) to Viktor Orbán (in Hungary) to (Recep Tayyip) Erdoğan in Turkey that has not sought to attack, weaken and essentially control universities.” The faculty and students facing immigration actions Mahmoud Khalil is a prominent Palestinian activist who played a central role last year in campus protests at Columbia against the Israel-Hamas war. A legal permanent US resident and spouse of a US citizen, he was arrested by immigration officers in early March outside his apartment on Columbia’s New York campus. The Trump administration has accused the Syrian-born Palestinian refugee – without providing evidence – of being a terrorist sympathizer, supporting Hamas and promoting the organization on campus, which Khalil denies. White House officials have also said Khalil distributed flyers promoting Hamas, a claim his lawyers deny. Khalil’s attorneys argue the Trump administration targeted him for his pro-Gaza views and participating in demonstrations in support of Palestinians, violating his First and Fifth Amendment protections. He remains detained at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Louisiana after a judge this week ordered his case transferred to New Jersey from New York. Dr. Rasha Alawieh is a kidney transplant physician and a teacher at Brown in Rhode Island. She was detained for more than a day last week at Boston Logan International Airport upon her return from a visit to her native Lebanon. Federal agents found photos of former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran’s supreme leader that had been deleted in a folder on Alawieh’s cell phone, a source familiar with the case told CNN. “Dr. Alawieh stated that she did not want to give authorities the perception that she supports Hezbollah and the Ayatollah politically or militarily,” a court filing obtained by CNN affiliate WCVB reads. Alawieh, 34, acknowledged to federal agents she had attended Nasrallah’s funeral – a public event attended by thousands – during her visit in Beirut and told them Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, according to the source. The group is a designated terror organization in the US and many other Western countries. “I think if you listen to one of his sermons, you would know what I mean,” Alawieh allegedly told the agents, according to WCVB’s copy of the filing. “He is a religious, spiritual person. As I said, he has very high value. His teachings are about spirituality and morality.” “Our client is in Lebanon, and we’re not going to stop fighting to get her back in the US to see her patients, and we’re also going to make sure that the government follows the rule of law,” an attorney representing Alawieh’s family in a federal complaint fighting the deportation, Stephanie Marzouk, told reporters in mid-March outside a Boston courthouse. Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral fellow and an Indian citizen doing “research on peace building in Iraq and Afghanistan,” faces expulsion from the US, Georgetown University in Washington, DC, announced this week. Khan Suri was detained by the Department of Homeland Security, which accuses him of “actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,” an agency spokesperson said on X, adding: “Khan Suri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.” “[Khan] Suri’s activities and presence in the United State[s] rendered him deportable” under the statute that empowers the top UP diplomat to act if he believes a non-citizen could have “serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States,” the spokesperson said. Khan Suri is innocent, his lawyer Hassan Ahmad said. A federal judge on Thursday ruled the Trump administration could not deport Khan Suri. US District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles said that while she reviews his petition, the administration is not to remove him from the country unless she issues another ruling to the contrary, according to the order. “We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity and we have not received a reason for his detention,” the university’s Interim President Robert Groves told its Board of Directors in a letter obtained by CNN. Khan Suri’s family has not been given any information about his detention, his sister, Khushnuma Khan, told CNN. That includes their parents who live in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. “We are currently confused about how and why this is happening to him,” she said. “If an accomplished scholar who focuses on conflict resolution is whom the government decides is bad for foreign policy,” Ahmad said, “then perhaps the problem is with the government, not the scholar.”  \n",

      "President Donald Trump made at least nine false claims in his Friday remarks to reporters in the Oval Office – including a series of wildly exaggerated statistics on a variety of topics. Trump used inaccurate figures for the number of votes he received in the 2024 presidential election, US aid to Ukraine, the number of migrants who entered the US during the Biden administration, the US trade deficits with China and Canada, and annual US fentanyl deaths. He also wrongly declared, again, that Honda announced it is building a new factory in Indiana. He repeated his years-old baseless claim that NATO would no longer have existed if not for his first presidency. He told his familiar unsubstantiated story about large numbers of migrants having come from jails in “the Congo” and elsewhere. And he once more discussed Canada’s dairy tariffs without mentioning a critical fact about them. While criticizing a federal judge who is presiding over a challenge to one of Trump’s immigration actions, Trump exaggerated his own vote total in the 2024 election – saying of the judge, “He didn’t run for president. He didn’t get much more than 80 million votes.” Trump received about 77.3 million votes in the 2024 election, his highest total in the three consecutive presidential elections in which he was a candidate. There is no basis for his repeated suggestions that the 2024 count was inaccurate. Honda and Indiana: While touting his use of tariffs on imported goods to get companies to increase their US manufacturing, Trump claimed, as he did in his address to Congress early this month, that Honda is building a new factory in Indiana. “We have a big one: Honda is building – just announced – a really big plant in Indiana,” he said Friday. But Honda has made no such announcement. Reuters, citing anonymous sources, reported early this month that Honda is planning to build its next-generation Civic hybrid in Indiana rather than Mexico as originally planned. The report did not say Honda was building a new factory; it already builds vehicles at an existing Indiana plant. In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, Honda thanked Trump “for recognizing our commitment to manufacturing vehicles in America” and touted its investment of “over $3 billion in advanced vehicle manufacturing in America in just the past three years” – but also noted, “Honda did not announce plans for a new plant in the U.S. at this time.” Honda said Friday, after Trump’s latest remarks, that this statement still stands. The US trade deficit with China: Trump repeated his false claim that the US trade deficit with China has hit $1 trillion or more, again blaming former President Joe Biden for this supposed situation. Trump said: “We have a trillion-dollar deficit, because of Biden, with President Xi; more than that – I mean, I’ve heard $1.2 trillion.” Those numbers are not close to accurate. In fact, official federal figures show that the 2024 deficit with China in goods and services trade was $263.3 billion. That’s up from $252.1 billion in 2023 – but lower than in every year of Trump’s first presidency. The 2024 deficit with China in goods trade alone was $295.2 billion. The US trade deficit with Canada: Reiterating his desire for Canada to become the 51st US state, Trump repeated his false claim that “it costs us $200 billion a year in subsidy to keep Canada afloat.” Trump has repeatedly used this $200 billion figure to describe the US trade deficit with Canada, which is actually far lower than that; official US statistics show the 2024 deficit with Canada in goods and services trade was $35.7 billion and $70.6 billion in goods trade alone. Even if he was this time using the word “subsidy” more broadly, there is no basis for the claim. Canada’s dairy tariffs: Trump correctly noted that Canada has 270% tariffs on some US dairy products. However, he failed to mention that Canada’s high dairy tariffs only kick in after the US hits a certain Trump-negotiated quantity of tariff-free dairy sales to Canada each year – and as the US dairy industry acknowledges, the US is not hitting its zero-tariff maximum in any category of dairy product, so the tariffs aren’t being applied.

      "The University of California system and Princeton this week joined more than a dozen top schools – including Harvard, Duke and Stanford – in announcing hiring freezes following Trump administration spending cuts. Johns Hopkins University said it was laying off more than 2,000 employees after it lost more than $800 million from US Agency for International Development funding amid White House efforts to reduce wasteful spending and downsize the federal government. The drastic moves come as dozens of colleges and universities face federal investigations for allegedly failing to protect Jewish students during pro-Palestinian demonstrations that disrupted campuses across the country last spring over the war in Gaza. And in the biggest salvo in the escalating war against elite universities, the Trump administration this month targeted Columbia University, canceling about $400 million in federal grants and contracts over allegations of antisemitism on campus. The university on Friday made apparent concessions, announcing a series of new policies, including restrictions on demonstrations, new disciplinary procedures and immediately reviewing its Middle East curriculum. Washington’s unprecedented campaign against the Ivy League school has the attention of US higher education leaders, who must weigh whether to acquiesce or fight back against a series of onslaughts on issues from pro-Palestinian activism to diversity programs to transgender women competing in women’s sports. The dangerous assault against the country’s leading universities, higher education leaders warn, has unfolded rapidly on multiple fronts – threatening not only America’s economic and technological strength but also its vaunted democratic system and traditions of academic freedom and free speech. “It is, I think, the most serious intrusion into academic freedom, and the autonomy of universities,” said Lee Bollinger, a First Amendment scholar and Columbia’s president for more than two decades. “We’re seeing a kind of effort to transform all parts of the government and all major parts of civil society to bring those into a partisan ideological conformity that is characteristic of emergent authoritarian regimes.” The warning signs, Bollinger said, are evident: Attempts to gain greater control over traditional civil service sector and administrative agencies; the ignoring of the rule of law and judicial orders; the attacks on the media and law firms and universities; and the crackdown on equity and inclusion programs. “The pattern of behavior here – the attacks on the courts, the attacks on the rule of law, on law firms, on media and now on universities – they’re part of a pattern of intimidation that is very alarming,” Bollinger said. “How universities respond will play into how other institutions respond.” On Thursday, the White House delivered yet another blow, signing an executive order to begin dismantling the US Department of Education, which is responsible for administering federal funding for students with disabilities, along with federal Pell Grants for undergraduate students from low-income households. “I think this is a whole ‘nother level,” Morton Schapiro, an expert on the economics of higher education and former president of Northwestern University, said of the series of moves. “This is certainly the greatest challenge I’ve seen.” White House spokesperson Kush Desai defended the moves. “The Trump administration’s decision to pause federal grants to universities is linked to these institutions’ inability to address rising antisemitic violence and protect biological women on their campuses — factors that are also not conducive to intellectual inquiry and advancement,” Desai told CNN this week. “The Trump administration is committed to increasing transparency in our scientific research apparatus while cutting waste, fraud, and abuse.”  \n",

      "President-elect Donald Trump appears keen on launching a simultaneous trade war with America’s three biggest trade partners: Mexico, China and Canada. The price US consumers stand to pay for it could potentially be eased if companies move away from these countries. But where exactly will they go? Those three nations alone accounted for more than 40% of the total value of all goods the US imported last year, according to federal trade data. Trump recently pledged to impose an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports on top of existing ones. On the campaign trail, he also floated a 60% across-the-board tariff on Chinese goods. For Mexico and Canada, he said he plans to slap a new 25% tariff on all imports the very day he’s inaugurated. In Trump’s ideal world, these higher tariffs would directly boost domestic manufacturing, since US businesses would be able to avoid tariffs entirely. To further incentivize companies to move production to the US, Trump has also dangled tax breaks. But none of that is likely to cause a meaningful change in domestic production, said Daniel Anthony, managing director at Trade Partnership Worldwide, an economic research group. When Trump imposed steeper tariffs on Chinese goods in his first term, “very little production came back to the United States,” he said. That was partly due to a lack of readily available infrastructure to make certain goods in the US. But even if that infrastructure had existed, moving manufacturing to the US mostly translates to much higher production costs that directly feed to higher prices consumers pay. So, if tariffs on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican imports go up across the board, more businesses will likely look to shift their production to other nations to avoid what could be some of the steepest import taxes the US has seen in decades. These are the countries most likely to be considered by companies looking to relocate their manufacturing. The No. 1 contender Trade experts CNN spoke to were in agreement that Vietnam would likely be a top contender, since it’s relatively cheap to manufacture goods there. Already, the country is the seventh top exporter of goods to the US and a beneficiary of the trade war with China. From 2017, when Trump was first in office, to 2023, Vietnam more than doubled the amount of goods it exports to the US, surging from $47 billion to $114 billion last year. However, if a lot of companies have the same idea of moving to Vietnam at around the same time, it could get ugly. “You do hit some bandwidth constraints pretty quickly,” said Anthony. Not only that, but it could become more expensive to produce there as suppliers respond to the influx in demand by raising prices, he added. Cars With Mexico the top source of US motor vehicle imports, European nations like Germany could tap into their own production capabilities, said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Similarly, Japan and South Korea, also heavyweights in car manufacturing, could ramp up production, he said. Apparel and footwear In addition to Vietnam, Americans are likely to see more of their clothes and shoes coming from Indonesia, Bangladesh and Cambodia if there’s a new three-way trade war, said Anthony. Federal trade data shows that the US has increasingly been importing more apparel and shoes from these four nations in recent years. On the luxury footwear and apparel side, though, Italy may experience higher production demand, Anthony added. Electronics Taiwan, the third-highest exporter of electronics to the US last year, could further amp up production as more companies seek to move away from China, which was the top electronics exporter to the US last year, Setser told CNN. Other Southeast Asian countries that have been exporting more electronic goods to the US in recent years — like Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea and Japan — are likely to increase their manufacturing, he said. South Korea and Japan also have currency advantages; both the won and the yen have weakened significantly over the past year relative to the US dollar, making it cheaper for Americans to buy goods from there. Companies could also take a page from Apple’s book. The iPhone maker recently moved some of its production to India. That option looks less likely, Setser said, because most Indian manufacturing is set up to meet the demand of the world’s most populous country: India. However, electronic manufacturing in other Southeast Asian countries is set up to meet global demand. Many companies could simply end up staying put Many businesses may have existing contracts to manufacture goods in a particular location for a set period of time. But even if they don’t, “companies aren’t trying to avoid tariffs. They’re trying to get the lowest all-in cost for the best possible product,” Anthony told CNN. That means that some companies will be willing to absorb higher tariffs rather than moving elsewhere, if that ends up being the cheaper option. Case in point: Even after Trump began imposing higher tariffs on Chinese imports in 2018, many of which President Joe Biden left in place, the US didn’t stop importing goods from China entirely; it just stopped importing as much as it had been. For instance, in 2017, before the tariffs went into effect, 60% of all computer equipment the US imported came from China, according to federal trade data. Last year, China accounted for just 39% of all computer equipment the US imported. In total, the US imported $500 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2017, amounting to 22% of all US imports. Last year, however, the US imported $427 billion of goods from China, accounting for just 14% of total US imports. Over that timeframe, Mexican and Canadian imports each grew by more than $100 billion, with tariffs set at near zero because of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, combined with the simultaneous amplified tariffs levied on Chinese goods. That largely helps explain why Mexico overtook China as the top exporter to the US. Still, even with higher tariffs, Setser doesn’t think any auto producer is “going to want to abandon their expensive investments in Mexico,” especially because Mexico may escape higher tariffs as Trump appears more willing to negotiate a deal with them compared to China. “There’s bigger questions about moving out of China. And the hard thing about China is that there’s so much production capacity, and it’s so cheap.”  \n",

      "It was around 4 a.m. when University of Idaho student Dylan Mortensen said she was woken up by strange noises in her off-campus house. She and her roommates had returned earlier from a typical Saturday night out in the college town when the sounds spurred a night of terror with a flurry of panicked texts and unanswered calls. Three of Mortensen’s roommates and a boyfriend of one of the students would be found dead inside the house the next morning on November 13, 2022 — stabbed to death with no signs of a break-in. DNA from the brutal slayings ultimately led to the arrest of 30-year-old criminology graduate student Bryan Kohberger. A not guilty plea has been entered on his behalf for the murders of Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin. Mortensen and another roommate, Bethany Funke, are the only two from inside the three-story Moscow, Idaho, house to survive. Now, as Kohberger’s trial nears over two years later, the personal accounts and phone activity from the two surviving roommates provide more insight into what they say happened in the early morning hours of the murders as the defense attempts to discredit their testimony and call into question why they waited eight hours to call 911. Court documents paint a picture of a night filled with odd sounds, unknown voices, panicked texts, unanswered calls and a shadowy figure in the hallway – all in the setting of a college town that hadn’t experienced a murder since 2015. Not much is known about Mortensen and Funke, whose phone activity and personal accounts were revealed in court documents in the last several weeks. A wide-ranging gag order in the case prevents them from speaking publicly about their experience. While the defense tries to show through their filings the two surviving roommates spent an inordinate amount of time on their phones before calling 911 – an attempt to call into question their timeline of events – a psychological expert says a multitude of factors could’ve played into this delay. “When we are faced with trauma or fear, we all have different response systems, and there’s no one right response system,” said Elizabeth Cauffman, a psychological science professor at the University of California, Irvine. While a complete picture of that morning has yet to form, the surviving roommates’ accounts and documentation shed light on what the housemates endured in a case shrouded with mystery and speculation.  \n",

      "A landing gear support broke as a Delta Air Lines regional jet was landing before it flipped upside down, leaving passengers “hanging like bats” at Toronto Pearson International in February, according to a preliminary report from Canada’s Transportation Safety Board. Less than three seconds before touchdown, investigators noted, the plane warned pilots with an audible alarm that they were descending quickly and the plane banked to the right. It was still descending rapidly when it hit the runway, tilted 7.5 degrees to the right, the report said. The plane, a CRJ-900, operated by Endeavor Airlines as Delta Connection Flight 4819 from Minneapolis to Toronto, landed February 17 in a fiery crash that ripped off a wing and rolled the plane upside down. All 80 passengers and crew made it out alive. Twenty-one were injured, including two seriously. On touchdown, investigators determined the side-stay attached to the aircraft’s right main landing gear fractured, the gear retracted, and the right wing broke between the landing gear and fuselage, which is the central part of the plane. When the wing detached, 6,000 pounds of jet fuel onboard sprayed out leading to a fire and explosion. The cockpit door was jammed shut, so the pilots had to climb out of an emergency hatch located on the ceiling of the cockpit, the report says. Thursday’s preliminary report does not identify what caused the crash or the broken landing gear. An official determination on probable cause could take up to 600 days. “Accidents and incidents rarely stem from a single cause,” said Yoan Marier, chair of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada in a statement. “They’re often the result of multiple, complex interconnected factors, many extending beyond the aircraft and its operation to wider systemic issues.” Investigators have examined components of the flight controls on the crashed plane, but didn’t note any obvious pre-existing malfunctions, the report says. Investigators probing the crash replicated several approaches and landings in a CRJ-900 simulator, according to the report. Going forward, the safety board will examine the metal making up the wing, certification of the landing gear and wing, landing techniques and pilot training, the evacuation, as well as flight attendant training and coordination in emergencies. “For everyone at Endeavor Air and Delta, nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and our people,” Delta Air Lines said in a statement. “That’s why we remain fully engaged as participants in the investigation led by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. Out of respect for the integrity of this work that will continue through their final report, Endeavor Air and Delta will refrain from comment.”   \n",

      "The suburban reservoirs that supply 10% of New York City’s vaunted drinking water are getting saltier due to decades of road salt being spread near the system — and they will eventually have to be abandoned if nothing is done to reverse the trend, city officials warn. The plug wouldn’t have to be pulled until early next century, according to a new study. But the soaring saltiness could eventually affect the famous taste of the Big Apple’s water, which is sometimes called the champagne of tap water, and poses a challenge to managers of a system that serves more than 9 million people. “The conclusion of this study is that if we don’t change our ways, in 2100 the Croton Water System becomes a nice recreational facility, but it ceases to be a water supply,” Rohit Aggarwala, the city’s environmental protection commissioner, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “And that will directly impact everybody who drinks New York City water.” The Croton system dates back to 1842 — when the first Croton Aqueduct began delivering water to a reservoir in what is now Manhattan’s Central Park — and is now comprised of 12 reservoirs and three controlled lakes north of the city. The report found the concentration of chlorides — an indicator of salinization — tripled from 1987 to 2019 in the system’s main reservoir, which is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of the city line. Concentrations are on track to exceed the state’s maximum contaminant level for chloride by 2108. The report found salinity increases across the sprawling system of city reservoirs in upstate New York. However, the problem is far less of an issue in the Delaware and Catskill watersheds west of the Hudson River, which supply about 90% of the city’s water. That’s likely because there’s far less development in those watersheds. Road salt is considered a main driver of the increase, along with sewage treatment plant discharges and water softeners. Millions of tons of rock salt is spread on US roads each winter as a cheap and effective way to reduce accidents. “It’s really a problem across the country in areas with a lot of snow,” said Shannon Roback, science director for the environmental group Riverkeeper. “We’ve seen rising levels of salt in water in the Northeast, in the Midwest and in most places that use road salt.” Roback noted that high salt levels in drinking water pose a host of environmental concerns and can be harmful to people on low-sodium diets. Aggarwala said the city has a few options. Salt can be removed from water supplies through reverse osmosis systems, though the technology is expensive and requires a lot of energy. The city also could mix Croton water with less salty water from its other two watersheds. But the commissioner said that would not be a solution for the more than a dozen municipalities north of New York City that draw water from the Croton system. City officials believe reducing the use of road salt locally is the most sensible option. That could involve persuading state and local road crews to use alternatives to salt, or sensors on plows to gauge road surface temperatures, or shutting off the applicators when plows make U-turns or K turns. State Sen. Pete Harckham, who represents the area, called the new report alarming, but not surprising given a number of community wells taken offline due to high chloride levels. The Democrat is sponsoring bills that would address the road salt issue, including one that would study the issue in the Croton watershed. “State agencies, local governments, everyone needs to come together on this,” he said, “because this is a real challenge.”  \n",

      "As the chief judge for the federal court in Washington, DC, Boasberg is well-liked in wonky legal circles and in the courthouse community. He’s a former law school roommate of Brett Kavanaugh and his personality has poked through his rulings with quirky uses of Star Trek quotes and Fugees lyrics.Even with 23 years as a judge in DC, Boasberg is very far from a household name. That all changed last week when Boasberg was randomly assigned a case that put him at a loggerheads with President Donald Trump and his administration’s efforts to use colonial-era laws and send undocumented immigrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador. His attempts to reign in Trump administration officials who appeared to violate his orders with controversial deportation flights to El Salvador earned him the unwanted position of being the target of Trump’s red-hot fury. In a series of social media posts, Trump smeared Boasberg as a “Radical Left Lunatic Judge” and called for his impeachment, drawing a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts. You wouldn’t know it from Trump’s angry reaction, but plenty of Boasberg’s past rulings and actions have actually aligned with the president’s political interests. Boasberg was known for giving lenient punishments to January 6 rioters. In Trump’s first term, he released FISA court materials that exposed huge problems with the FBI’s probe into connections between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia’s election meddling. He also paved the way for conservative groups to obtain some of Hillary Clinton’s emails from her private server. He’s also currently presiding over another high-profile and consequential federal cases: the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit against Meta, the parent company of Facebook. “Boasberg is the opposite of a radical judge,” one former Justice Department prosecutor, who tried several January 6 cases in front of Boasberg, told CNN. “He was always fair and principled. You knew when you went into court with him, that he was going to follow the rules. He was very predictable because he followed the law. He is not a rash judge at all.” Trump all week has complained about Boasberg, calling him “a Grandstander, looking for publicity,” and saying Friday in the Oval Office that he’s “sitting behind a bench and has no idea what’s going on.” The militant rhetoric from senior Trump officials about disregarding Boasberg’s orders and in-court stonewalling from Justice Department lawyers have raised the specter of a brewing constitutional crisis. Trump says he sees the moment as a crisis as well – but one of Boasberg’s making, and it’s endangering American lives. Other White House aides said Boasberg was leading “the gravest assault on democracy” and that he committed an “egregious abuse of the bench.” In some ways, the controversy isn’t really about Boasberg. It’s Trump who has a history of bashing any judge that rules against him – and praising anyone that rules in his favor. And as often happens amid these disputes, pro-Trump influences have followed up his public outbursts with increasingly personal attacks about Boasberg’s family and doxing-esque details about his home in DC. Still, it’s not every day that the chief justice speaks out to defend a single lower-court judge. Even after Roberts’ public consternation, Trump continued attacking Boasberg and some House Republicans filed articles of impeachment that will likely go nowhere. But their ire is perhaps misplaced. Sources told CNN that they’ve never seen Boasberg as a partisan actor. He has handed down plenty of Trump-favorable rulings. Boasberg, 62, was appointed to the DC district court by President Barack Obama and was previously named to DC’s local courts by President George W. Bush. “Remember who becomes federal judges – people who are willing to take a tenfold pay cut to spend the rest of their lives resolving impossible legal questions,” said CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams, who clerked for two federal judges. “It’s just not a community that seeks out the spotlight. I don’t think there’s a federal judge in America who relishes being tweeted about.” Like most judges, Boasberg rarely speaks to the press and does not comment about cases. When he took the reins as chief judge in 2023, after his colleague Beryl Howell stepped aside, Boasberg emphasized that they prefer to work quietly, behind the scenes. “Neither of us will be Time’s person of the year,” Boasberg told CNN at the time.\n",

      "Americans applied for British citizenship in record numbers last year, with a historically high volume of applications submitted in the last quarter of 2024 – a period coinciding with US President Donald Trump’s re-election. More than 6,100 US citizens applied for UK citizenship last year, the most since records began in 2004, when fewer than 3,000 Americans submitted an application, according to data from the UK’s Home Office. Last year’s numbers also saw a marked uptick from 2023, a year with fewer than 5,000 applications by US citizens. Applications by Americans soared in the last three months of 2024, when more than 1,700 people applied – the most in any quarter in the past two decades. The surge is reminiscent of an upswing recorded in the first six months of 2020, when more than 5,800 Americans gave up their citizenship, nearly tripling the number from all of 2019. That uptick came in the wake of Trump’s first presidency and changes in tax policy, analysts argued then, and were mostly Americans who had already been living in Britain for some time. While many people who renounced their citizenship complained of being unhappy with the political climate in the US, another reason for their decision is often taxes, Alistair Bambridge, a partner at Bambridge Accountants, told CNN in August 2020. Trump himself could apply for British citizenship, through his late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born and raised in Scotland before leaving as a 17-year-old for the United States to work as a domestic servant in 1930. European escape As more Americans scramble for UK passports, some British citizens have recently sought their own backups. In the years following the UK’s vote to leave the European Union (EU) in 2016, the number of Britons applying for Irish passports – giving them the right to freely work, live and travel across Europe - almost doubled. And with Trump’s re-election in November last year leaving Americans around the world worried about what the next four years may bring, some communities have sniffed an opportunity. An Italian village launched a website aimed at would-be American expats, offering up more cheap homes in the hope that those upset by the election’s outcome will rush to snap up one of its empty properties – and revive its fortunes after decades of depopulation. “Are you worned (sic) out by global politics? Looking to embrace a more balanced lifestyle while securing new opportunities?” the website asks. “It’s time to start building your European escape in the stunning paradise of Sardinia.”  \n",

      "The Trump administration is canceling 83% of programs at the US Agency for International Development and intends to fold the remaining programs under the State Department, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday. The move to have the remaining 1,000 USAID programs administered by the State Department would cap the quick and drastic dismantlement of the US’ independent humanitarian organization, which had been demonized by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. “After a 6 week review we are officially cancelling 83% of the programs at USAID,” Rubio said in a post on X from his personal account, not his official secretary of state one. “The 5200 contracts that are now cancelled spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States,” he claimed without providing details on the canceled contracts. “In consultation with Congress, we intend for the remaining 18% of programs we are keeping (approximately 1000) to now be administered more effectively under the State Department,” he said. “Thank you to DOGE and our hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform,” Rubio said, referencing the Musk-backed office that has installed officials throughout the federal agencies and taken controversial steps to slash federal spending. In a response to the post, Musk – with whom Rubio had reportedly feuded – said, “Tough, but necessary.” “Good working with you. The important parts of USAID should always have been with Dept of State,” said Musk, who repeatedly bashed USAID and said it should be fed into a woodchipper. In a court filing in late February, the administration said it had terminated nearly 5,800 USAID awards. According to a court filing, Rubio had “made a final decision with respect to each award, on an individualized basis, affirmatively electing to either retain the award or terminate it pursuant to the terms of the instrument or independent legal authority as inconsistent with the national interests and foreign policy of the United States.” Sources who spoke to CNN at the time said those terminations included funding for programs that had been deemed lifesaving and granted waivers to the sweeping foreign aid freeze. Several humanitarian officials described the terminations of the awards as “a bloodbath.” Others said the rollout of the terminations from the State Department and USAID was confusing and unexpected, even to some officials within those agencies. There were reports that some terminated contracts had been restored. CNN has reached out to the State Department for more information, including the difference in figures between Rubio’s post and the court filing. USAID dispenses billions of dollars annually across the world in an effort to alleviate poverty, treat diseases and respond to famines and natural disasters. It also promotes democracy building and development by supporting non-government organizations, independent media and social initiatives. Most of that work has ground to a halt because of the moves of the Trump administration, which alleged misuse and fraud. In early February, Rubio revealed he was acting administrator of USAID and told Congress he had directed a deputy, Pete Marocco, “to begin the process of engaging in a review and potential reorganization of USAID’s activities to maximize efficiency and align operations with the national interest.” “USAID may move, reorganize, and integrate certain missions, bureaus, and offices into the Department of State, and the remainder of the Agency may be abolished consistent with applicable law,” Rubio wrote in a letter to Capitol Hill at the time. The administration’s foreign aid freeze, which halted payments to nonprofits and contractors, as well as its moves to dismantle USAID have been challenged in the courts. A federal judge has allowed the administration to move forward with putting people on leave and terminations, but another federal judge ruled that the administration must pay out nearly $2 billion in unpaid fees for humanitarian work. The Supreme Court upheld the latter ruling last week but did not provide a timeline for pay out.  \n",

      "When Dora Camarena was on her deathbed in 2021, her family recalls she wished to have lived long enough to see the Mexican cartel that killed her son pay for what it did. Forty years after his killing, the widow and sons of DEA special agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena are taking the Sinaloa Cartel to court – seeking financial compensation from living members of the drug trafficking organization, and counting on President Donald Trump’s designation of some cartels as terror groups. “For decades, we have carried the pain of his loss, but also his courage,” recounts Myrna Camarena, the slain agent’s sister said in a statement. “Justice is long overdue, and we will not stop until it is served.” In a federal lawsuit filed Thursday in the U.S. Southern District of California, Geneva Camarena, her sons, and other family members, are suing former heads of the Sinaloa and Guadalajara Cartels - which according to court documents, merged in the 1970s. The Sinaloa cartel, named after the Mexican state where it was formed, is one of the oldest and most established drug trafficking groups in Mexico. It has long supplied much of the marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl peddled on US streets, according to a 2022 Congressional Research Service report. In the civil complaint, the Camarenas seek compensation for “substantial physical, emotional, and psychological damages inflicted” since February 7, 1985, when agent Camarena was kidnapped, tortured, and killed while working undercover in Guadalajara, Mexico. Authorities discovered the agent’s buried body at a Mexican ranch nearly a month later. As laid out in the lawsuit, Mexican courts later convicted cartel kingpin Rafael Caro-Quintero and cartel boss Felix Gallardo - along with other co-conspirators - for planning and directing the kidnapping of Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala-Avelar, to extract information about DEA operations in Mexico. “It has been 40 years since these men and their deadly criminal enterprise ended my husband’s life,” shared Geneva “Mika” Camarena in a statement to CNN. “We are so grateful that President Trump designated the cartels as terrorist organizations, which finally allows my family and me to seek justice,” she added. Caro-Quintero leads the list of three cartel defendants in the civil action. He spent nearly three decades in a Mexican prison before being released on a technicality in 2013 then subsequently recaptured in 2022 by Mexican forces. On February 27, 2025, the 72-year-old narco, known notoriously among US law enforcement as ”RCQ,” was transported into US custody by Mexican authorities and remains detained in Brooklyn facing US charges. In a March court appearance, he pleaded not guilty to charges related to Camarena’s killing and other drug-related charges. The recent lawsuit claims the grief of agent Camarena’s sons, Daniel, Eric, and Enrique Jr., was compounded by the nature of their father’s killing with some family members still grappling decades later. “Today, as an adult, Erik continues to struggle. He’s unable to watch violent movies and television shows without them triggering an emotional response and the question, is this what happened to my father,” a portion of the lawsuit says. In their complaint, the Camarena family argues they were victimized by acts of “international terrorism.” Attorneys for the family are relying on the Trump administration’s designation of the Sinaloa Cartel as a Foreign Terrorist Organization alleging the syndicate’s activities - including the murder of Camarena - are acts of international terrorism as defined by US statute. The suit - which makes other claims including wrongful death - was filed by Motley Rice LLC. The law firm says it represents 9/11 families in ongoing litigation against alleged terrorist financiers. “This family’s hope for a safer, more just world – the world Kiki Camarena fought for – has been renewed. We look forward to continuing this fight in his honor in court,” said Motley Rice anti-terrorism attorney, Michael E. Elsner.

      "\"The White House appears to have a carrot-and-stick approach to making America love Teslas. Buy the car and the stock, officials say. And anyone caught vandalizing a charging station should expect to be labeled a “terrorist thug,” one possibly bound for a Salvadorean prison, as President Donald Trump wrote Friday. The Trump administration’s unique affection for Tesla is just one of the ways that officials appear to be using their power to advance their own business interests in ways that ethics experts say are both unprecedented and alarming. “This is just not done,” Hui Chen, an anti-corruption expert and former federal prosecutor, told CNN. “This endorsement of a domestic brand in a space where there are many domestic players is unconventional, to say the least.” The latest warning from Trump came Friday, when he suggested that acts of vandalism against Tesla showrooms and vehicles were more concerning than the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, when a violent mob tried to overturn the 2020 election that Trump lost. “When I looked at those showrooms burning and those cars… exploding all over the place, these are terrorists,” Trump said in an Oval Office briefing. “You didn’t have that on January 6… these people are terrorists.” Of course, vandalism isn’t terrorism unless you drastically stretch the word’s meaning, Chen notes. Vandalism is a crime, but “to call vandalism against Tesla in this unique set of circumstances an act of terrorism… There’s just simply no basis for saying that,” she said. Trump’s comments Friday underscored a consistent message from his administration: that Tesla is special and should be treated as such. But any upside for Tesla’s business would directly enrich CEO Elon Musk, who is a special government employee overseeing an unofficial department that is trying to gut federal services and employment rolls. Last week, Trump staged a live Tesla ad on the White House’s South Lawn, telling reporters he would write Musk a check for one of them for himself. The spectacle offered Tesla shares a sharp but short-lived bump. It is not unusual for the US government to try to boost certain domestic industries broadly. But they don’t single out one business over and over the way they have with Tesla, an American company with several American rivals, said Jordan Libowitz, vice president for communications at the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. The Tesla cheerleading reached a new apex on Wednesday. As Tesla’s stock was tumbling, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick went on Fox News to urge viewers to buy Tesla’s “cheap” stock — a moment that appeared to violate government ethics rules and simultaneously offer misleading investment advice. (Despite Tesla shares losing about half their value since December, they are not, in fact, “cheap.” By traditional metrics, Tesla shares remain some of the most expensive on Wall Street, trading at 60 times its projected 2026 earnings, per Fortune.) Lutnick’s Tesla comments didn’t end up helping much, as Tesla’s stock — weighed down by falling sales and a growing brand crisis — fell 1.7% in premarket trading following his appearance. “Saying ‘buy the stock’ is something we can’t think of ever seeing before,” Libowitz said, noting that a large portion of Musk’s wealth is tied up in Tesla stock. “It’s hard to see it as anything other than the White House doing a solid for one of its senior people.” The White House, Commerce Department and Tesla didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n",

      "President Donald Trump announced the Pentagon’s decision to move forward with a next-generation fighter jet titled F-47 on Friday in joint remarks alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth from the Oval Office. “At my direction, the United States Air Force is moving forward with the world’s first sixth-generation fighter jet, number six, sixth generation, nothing in the world comes even close to it, and it’ll be known as the F-47,” Trump said. Trump announced that Boeing had been awarded the contract for the newest US fighter aircraft. The president went on to say an experimental version of the F-47 has been flying for almost five years. At the end of the first Trump administration, the Air Force acknowledged that it had flown a full-scale prototype of the jet. “After a rigorous and thorough competition between some of America’s top aerospace companies, the Air Force is going to be awarding the contract for the next generation air dominance platform to Boeing,” Trump announced. Until now, the program had been known as Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD). But in an apparent reference to his own presidency, Trump said the aircraft would be known as the F-47. Aircraft designations are normally announced by the Air Force. “It’s something the likes of which nobody has seen before,” Trump said, “and this has been in the works for a long period of time.” Trump also promised the F-47 would be able to cooperate with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are a major focus of the military, especially as the US has watched Ukraine and Russia effectively use drones in relatively inexpensive long-range attacks and employed drone swarms to overwhelm aerial defenses. “This plane flies with drones. It flies with many, many drones, as many as you want,” Trump said. “It’s a technology that’s new, but it doesn’t fly by itself. It flies with many drones, as many as you want, and that’s something that no other plane can do.” It was the Air Force’s decision to award the F-47 program to Boeing, but Trump’s celebration of the announcement was somewhat of a surprise, since he has repeatedly criticized the company. Trump has railed against Boeing for the cost overruns and delays with the next Air Force One. “We are getting a new Air Force One, if Boeing could ever finish the damn thing,” Trump said in February. Boeing’s leadership said they would try to move the delivery schedule up, but there’s “no silver bullet” for the program. Another major Boeing program for the Air Force - the KC-46 tanker - is projected to be more than seven years behind its original timeline for reaching full-rate production, according to the Government Accountability Office, a far cry from the Trump administration’s goal of producing systems faster and more efficiently. For decades, Boeing produced the backbone of the US bomber fleet, from B-17s and B-29s in World War II to B-52s that rolled off the assembly line in the 1960s and are still flying today. Boeing now produces the F-15EX Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet, two major platforms for the Air Force and the Navy, respectively. These fighter aircraft are derivatives of designs initially developed by McDonnell Douglas, an aircraft manufacturer that merged with Boeing in 1997. The last production fighter designed and built exclusively by Boeing is the P-26 Peashooter, which first flew in 1932. Boeing also designed and built the X-32 Joint Strike Fighter, which ultimately lost out to the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. Late-last year, the Air Force paused the decision on how to proceed with the sixth-generation fighter. The Air Force said in December that then-Secretary Frank Kendall would defer the decision to the Trump administration. The Next Generation Air Dominance program is intended to produce the US military’s sixth-generation fighter jet, newer and more advanced than the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, which has suffered from major cost overruns and delays. Elon Musk has railed against the F-35, instead advocating for unmanned drone swarms as a cheaper, more effective weapon. On social media in November, Musk said “Meanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35.” When Lockheed Martin was awarded the F-35 in October 2001, the weapons maker said the program would cost approximately $200 billion. The company’s CEO promised the F-35 would be “capable and affordable” and be produced “on schedule and cost.” More than two decades later, the total cost of the program has exceeded $2 trillion, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), as the military services “plan to use it less.”  \n",

      "President Donald Trump on Friday downplayed his involvement in invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants, saying for the first time that he hadn’t signed the proclamation, even as he stood by his administration’s move. “I don’t know when it was signed, because I didn’t sign it,” Trump told reporters before leaving the White House on Friday evening. The president made his comments when asked to respond to Judge James Boasberg’s concerns in court on Friday that the proclamation was “signed in the dark” of night and that migrants were hurried onto planes. “We want to get criminals out of our country, number one, and I don’t know when it was signed, because I didn’t sign it,” Trump said. “Other people handled it, but (Secretary of State) Marco Rubio has done a great job and he wanted them out and we go along with that. We want to get criminals out of our country.” The proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act appears in the Federal Register with Trump’s signature at the bottom. Hours after the president made his comments on Friday, the White House claimed that Trump was not talking about whether he signed the document last week. “President Trump was obviously referring to the original Alien Enemies Act that was signed back in 1798,” a White House statement said. “The recent Executive Order was personally signed by President Trump invoking the Alien Enemies Act that designated Tren de Aragua as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in order to apprehend and deport these heinous criminals.” Yet Trump’s assertion that “other people handled it,” and his specific citation of Rubio, is at odds with that White House statement. Trump raised Rubio’s name without prompting from reporters. When he was then asked a hypothetical question about whether he would send another deportation flight to El Salvador tonight amid the ongoing litigation, Trump said it would be up to Rubio. “I would say that I’d have the Secretary of State handle it, because I’m not really involved in that, but the concept of getting bad people murderers, rapists, drug dealers, all of the, these are really some bad people out of our country. I ran on that. I won on that,” Trump said. At a hearing earlier Friday, Boasberg vowed to find out whether officials in the Trump administration violated his orders temporarily blocking the use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations by refusing to turn two flights around last weekend. “I will get to the bottom of whether they violated my order – who ordered this and what the consequences will be,” Boasberg said near the end of the hourlong hearing over whether he should lift the pair of orders he issued last Saturday. Boasberg, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, appeared incensed over how the Justice Department has handled the fast-moving case, opening the hearing by tearing into the tone the administration had taken in some of its court filings. He told DOJ attorney Drew Ensign that the government had used “intemperate and disrespectful” language that he’s “never seen from the United States” as it pushed various legal arguments before him earlier this week, including the suggestion his orders from the bench last Saturday carried less weight than a written order that was issued shortly after those proceedings. Much of Friday’s hearing focused on arguments from the Justice Department for why Boasberg should lift his orders to stop, for now, Trump’s use of the 18th-century law to quickly deport some migrants whom the US has accused of being affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The administration is arguing that Boasberg exceeded his authority in blocking the removals because, they say, Trump’s use of the act is an unreviewable by federal courts.\n",

      "President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the US would sell a “gold card” to wealthy foreigners, giving them the right to live and work in the US and offering a path to citizenship in exchange for a $5 million fee. “We’re going to be selling a gold card,” Trump said from the Oval Office. “You have a green card. This is a gold card. We’re going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million and that’s going to give you green card privileges, plus it’s going to be a route to citizenship. And wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card.” Trump said the sale of the cards will begin in about two weeks and suggested millions of such cards could be sold. Asked whether he would consider selling the cards to Russian oligarchs, Trump responded: “Yeah, possibly. I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, standing alongside Trump, said the card will replace the government’s EB-5 immigrant investor visa program, which allows foreign investors to pump money into US projects that create jobs and then apply for visas to immigrate to the US. “They’ll have to go through vetting, of course,” Lutnick said, “to make sure they’re wonderful world-class global citizens.” Created by Congress in 1992, the EB-5 program can grant green cards to immigrants who make a minimum investment of least $1,050,000, or $800,000 in economically distressed zones called targeted employment areas, to create jobs for American workers, according to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services website. Businesses connected to Trump and his family have also made use of the program to fund major property developments. The program drew bipartisan criticism from lawmakers in Congress during Trump’s first term, with many warning that it had deviated from its goals and was in need of reform. The Trump administration in 2019 moved to raise the minimum investment amount for targeted economic areas to $900,000, and $1.8 million in other locations, but a federal judge struck down the change in 2021, finding that the acting Homeland Security secretary who authorized the rule had not been properly appointed. The program was last renewed in 2022 during the Biden administration, with the minimum investment requirements being raised to their current levels.  \n",

      "US military officials are scrambling to develop a “Golden Dome” defense system that can protect the country from long-range missile strikes and have been told by the White House that no expense will be spared in order to fulfill one of President Donald Trump’s top Pentagon priorities, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. “Golden Dome” is the Trump administration’s attempt to rebrand vague plans for developing a missile defense system akin to Israel’s Iron Dome. At a time the Pentagon is looking to cut budgets, the Trump administration has ordered military officials to ensure future funding for “Golden Dome” is reflected in new budget estimates for 2026 to 2030 – but the system itself remains undefined beyond a name, the sources said. “Right now, Golden Dome is, it’s really an idea,” one source familiar with internal discussions about the project said, adding there may be technology in the pipeline that, if ever scaled up, could apply to it, but as of now discussions are purely conceptual. That makes projecting future costs nearly impossible, the source added, though it would likely cost billions of dollars to construct and maintain. Trump has repeatedly insisted the US needs a missile defense program similar to Israel’s Iron Dome, but the systems are orders of magnitude apart. In practical terms, the comparison is less apples to oranges, and more apples to aircraft carriers. Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system selectively protects populated areas from short-range threats in a country the size of New Jersey; Trump wants a space-based missile defense system capable of defending the entire United States from advanced ballistic and hypersonic missiles. For one thing, “Israel is tiny,” the source familiar with ongoing internal discussions about the Golden Dome project said. “So, it is 100% feasible to blanket Israel in things like radars and a combination of mobile and fixed interceptors.” “How are you going to do that in the United States? You can’t do it just at the borders and the shoreline, because intercontinental ballistic missiles, they can re-enter the atmosphere over Kansas.” Still, Trump issued an executive order during his first week in office ordering Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to submit a plan for developing and implementing the next-generation missile defense shield by March 28. And a senior Pentagon official insisted earlier this week that work is underway. “Consistent with protecting the homeland and per President Trump’s [executive order], we’re working with the industrial base and [through] supply chain challenges associated with standing up the Golden Dome,” Steven J. Morani, currently performing the duties of undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment said this week at the McAleese Defense Programs Conference in Washington. At the same time, Pentagon officials have been realigning the Defense Department’s 2026 budget proposal to meet Hegseth’s priorities, which were outlined in a memo delivered to senior leaders last week and represents a major overhaul of the military’s strategic goals, according to a copy obtained by CNN. The memo specifically directs Pentagon leadership to focus on strengthening missile defense of the US homeland through Trump’s “Golden Dome.” “There is a rigorous analytic process underway taking a relook at [the budget],” Morani added. “This is standard practice for any new administration that takes office.” But it remains unclear how much money the Pentagon will request for Trump’s Golden Dome in its budget proposal or how officials will determine the amount of funding is required. Retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery believes creating a ballistic missile defense system may be possible in 7-10 years, but even then, it will have severe limitations, potentially capable of protecting only critical federal buildings and major cities. “The more you want it closer to 100%, the more expensive it’s going to get,” said Montgomery, the senior director of the Center On Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. A comprehensive system will require different sets of satellites for communication, sensing incoming missiles, and launching interceptors, Montgomery told CNN. Those types of systems are long-term projects, he said, requiring existing defenses to fill the gap in the meantime. “You’ve gotta be responsible here,” Montgomery said. “You’re not going to be able to defend everything with these ground-based missiles. They defend a circle around them, but it’s not large.” Potential pay day for arms companies US arms manufacturers are already seeing dollar signs. The Missile Defense Agency held an Industry Day in mid-February to solicit bids from companies interested in helping to plan and build Golden Dome. The agency received more than 360 secret and unclassified abstracts about ideas for how to plan and execute the system. Lockheed Martin has taken it a step further, creating a polished website for Golden Dome claiming the world’s largest defense contractor has the “proven, mission-tested capabilities and track record of integration to bring this effort to life.” In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative to create a space-based defense against ballistic nuclear missiles. The system was derisively nicknamed “Star Wars,” and consumed tens of billions of dollars before it was ultimately cancelled, facing insurmountable technical and economic hurdles. Laura Grego, a Senior Research Director of the Global Security Program at the Union for Concerned Scientists, says the same challenges remain and have been known for years. “It has been long understood that defending against a sophisticated nuclear arsenal is technically and economically unfeasible,” Grego told CNN. America’s current ballistic missile defense is designed to thwart a small number of missiles from a rogue state such as North Korea or Iran. The system relies on the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), which has failed nearly half of its tests, according to the Arms Control Association, rendering it incapable of stopping a major attack from Russia or China. But in his executive order, Trump called for a far more complex and robust system - space-based interceptors capable of downing a target moments after it launches. Such a system would require thousands of interceptors in low-earth orbit to intercept even a single North Korean missile launch, according to the American Physical Society (APS), which has studied the feasibility of ballistic missile defenses for years. A single interceptor in orbit is almost never at the right place and time to rapidly intercept a ballistic missile launch, so you need exponentially more to ensure adequate coverage. “We estimate that a constellation of about 16,000 interceptors would be needed to attempt to counter a rapid salvo of ten solid-propellant ICBMs like the [North Korean] Hwasong-18,” the APS wrote in a study earlier this month. Even then, Grego says a space-based missile defense system is vulnerable to enemy anti-satellite attacks from far less expensive ground-based systems. “The most critical weakness of a system like this is its brittleness, its vulnerability to attack,” Grego added. In the Red Sea, the US has fired scores of multi-million dollar interceptor missiles at Houthi drones and missiles that cost a fraction of the price. The fiscal imbalance gets far worse when the system is in space, according to John Tierney, a former Democratic congressman who held years of hearings on ballistic missile defense. “It’s a joke. It’s basically a scam,” Tierney said bluntly. Now the executive director for the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation, Tierney ripped Trump for being “willing to throw billions and billions and billions of dollars at something that won’t work.”  \n",

      "Europe’s American century is over. Two geopolitical thunderclaps on Wednesday will transform transatlantic relations. Donald Trump’s call with Vladimir Putin brought the Russian leader in from the cold as they hatched plans to end the war in Ukraine and agreed to swap presidential visits. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, meanwhile, went to Brussels and told European allies to “take ownership of conventional security on the continent.” The watershed highlights Trump’s “America First” ideology and his tendency to see every issue or alliance as a dollars and cents value proposition. It also underscores his freedom from establishment advisors steeped in the foreign policy mythology of the West, who he thinks thwarted his first term. Although Hegseth recommitted to NATO, something fundamental has changed. America’s interventions won two world wars that started in Europe and afterwards guaranteed the continent’s freedom in the face of the Soviet threat. But Trump said on the campaign trail he might not defend alliance members who haven’t invested enough in defense. He thus revived a perennial point posed most eloquently by Winston Churchill in 1940 about when “The New World, with all its power and might” will step “forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.” Trump is returning to the rationale used by many presidents wary of foreign entanglements from the start of the republic, saying Wednesday, “We have a little thing called an ocean in between.” Hegseth’s stunning bluntness It’s long been clear that the second Trump administration would place new demands on America’s European partners, which will now lead to agonized choices for governments that have chosen social spending over defense. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told the European Parliament last month that Europeans must come up with more cash for their militaries. “If you don’t do it, get your Russian language courses or go to New Zealand,” he said. But Hegseth was still jarring. He formalized Trump’s demand for alliance members to spend 5% of GDP on defense and said the US would prioritize its growing clash with China and the security of its borders over Europe’s. “The United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency,” said the new Pentagon chief, who was wearing a stars-and-stripes pocket square. The tough new approach is not like Trump’s fantasy of displacing Gaza’s Palestinians to build the “Riviera of the Middle East.” It’s a rational response to changed political realities. The Greatest Generation that fought World War II and produced presidents who understood the dangers of a power vacuum in Europe is gone. Any American who has an adult memory of the Cold War against the Soviet Union is in their mid 50s at least. And the most powerful competitor to the United States is in Asia not Europe. So, it’s fair for Trump to ask why the continent has still not taken over its own self-defense 80 years after the defeat of the Nazis. Successive American presidents and European leaders have failed to rethink NATO for the 21st century. In retrospect, the transatlantic alliance left itself badly exposed to the most transactional and nationalist American president since the 19th century. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested in a recent interview on “The Megyn Kelly Show” on Sirius XM that the US should not be the “front end” of European security but rather the “back stop.” And he rebuked big European powers. “When you ask those guys, why can’t you spend more on national security, their argument is because it would require us to make cuts to welfare programs, to unemployment benefits, to being able to retire at 59 and all these other things,” Rubio said. “That’s a choice they made. But we’re subsidizing that?” Trump’s treatment of allies like Canada and Mexico, as well as his calls for Denmark to hand over Greenland, shows his disdain for the multilateral US foreign policy of old. He’s always praising Putin and China’s President Xi Jinping over their smarts and strength. It’s obvious he thinks them the only worthy interlocutors for the tough leader of another great power, the United States. “Trump’s agenda isn’t about European security: it’s that he thinks the USA shouldn’t pay for European security,” said Nicholas Dungan, founder and CEO of CogitoPraxis, a strategic consultancy in The Hague. “This isn’t a new era of transatlantic relations, it’s a new era of global big-power relations replacing the deliberately institutional structures of the liberal international order.” The US message on Ukraine that Europe didn’t want to hear The first test of this new US-Europe reality will come over Ukraine. Trump said that negotiations to end the Ukraine war will start “immediately” after his call with Putin, who has been frozen out by the West since his illegal invasion of Ukraine, a sovereign democracy, three years ago. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was not included, in an alarming sign for the government in Kyiv. Zelensky was at the center of everything the Biden administration did on the war. Trump did call Zelensky later Wednesday, but the American president is already fueling fears he’ll cook up a resolution that favors Russia. Asked by a reporter whether Ukraine would be an equal partner in peace talks, Trump replied: “It’s an interesting question,” and appeared to think carefully, before replying, “I said that was not a good war to go into,” apparently buying Putin’s line that the conflict was the fault of a nation brutally invaded by an authoritarian neighbor. Hegseth was just as blunt. He laid out US starting points for the negotiation: that Ukraine could not return to its pre-2014 borders before the invasion of Crimea, that it could not join NATO and that US troops would play no part of any security force to guarantee any eventual peace. Any peacekeeping force would have to be made up of European and non-European troops and would not be covered by NATO’s mutual defense clause — meaning the US wouldn’t bail it out in the event of a clash with Moscow’s forces. Former President Joe Biden was also reticent about Ukraine getting a path to NATO membership, fearing a clash with nuclear-armed Russia that could morph into World War III. And Trump’s insistence that European peacekeepers will not wear NATO uniforms will be seen as a similarly prudent move by many observers to avoid dragging the US into a conflict with Russia. But Wednesday was also the best day for Putin since the invasion, since it swept away many of Ukraine’s aspirations. Hegseth argued that he was simply dispensing realism. And he has a point. No one in the US or Europe thought the clock could be turned back to 2014. And Ukraine was unable to win back its land on the battlefield despite billions of dollars in Western aid. Still, by taking such issues off the table, Trump, the supposed deal maker supreme, deprived the Ukrainians of a bargaining chip that could have been used to win concessions from his old friend Putin. As it stands, Trump seems to have no objection to Russia retaining the spoils of its unprovoked invasion. This is not surprising — since like Russia, America now has a president who believes great powers are entitled to expansionism in their regional areas of influence. But rewarding Russia with a favorable settlement would set a disastrous precedent. A chilling historical analogy The US-Russia call and a future summit with Putin in Saudi Arabia, which Trump said would happen soon, may be a hint that he’s not just cutting Zelensky out of the deal – but Europe too. In a statement, France, Germany, Poland, Italy, Spain, the European Union, the European Commission, plus the United Kingdom and Ukraine, warned “Ukraine and Europe must be part of any negotiations.” And they warned Trump, who seems to want a peace deal at any cost, that “a just and lasting peace in Ukraine is a necessary condition for a strong transatlantic security.” Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt is worried by the cozy call between Trump and Putin. “The disturbing thing is of course that we have the two big guys, the two big egos … believing that they can maneuver all of the issues on their own,” he told Richard Quest on CNN International. Bildt evoked the most damning historical analogy possible — the appeasement of Adolf Hitler by Britain that allowed the Nazis to annex the Sudetenland. “For European ears, this sounds like Munich. It sounds like two big leaders wanting to have peace in our time, (over) a faraway country of which they know little. They are preparing to make a deal over the heads of that particular country. A lot of Europeans know how that particular movie ended.” Trump’s detailed strategy remains opaque. The dashing of many of Zelensky’s aspirations means that Kyiv’s agreement to any Putin-Trump deal cannot be taken for granted. And after his steady gains on the battlefield, there’s no certainty that the Russian leader is as desperate for a swift settlement as Trump, who has long craved a Nobel Peace Prize. But the framework of a possible settlement has been a topic of private conversations in Washington and European capitals for months, even during the Biden administration. As Hegseth made clear, Ukraine’s hopes of regaining all its lost land is unrealistic. What may emerge is a solution along the lines of the partition of Germany after World War II, with Russian-occupied territory frozen under its control with the rest of Ukraine — on the other side of a hard border – remaining a democracy. Perhaps the western edge would be allowed to join the European Union, like the old West Germany. But this time, US troops won’t make it safe for freedom. “The US position on Ukraine as articulated today should surprise no one in Europe: it’s just what European insiders have been saying to me off the record, in back channels, behind the scenes for two years: West Ukraine and East Ukraine, like West Germany and East Germany but in this case – EU Yes, NATO No,” said Dungan. Such a solution would conjure a cruel historical irony. Putin, who watched in despair from his post as a KGB officer in Dresden as the Soviet Union dissolved, may be on the verge of creating a new East Germany in 21st century Europe with America’s help.  \n",

      "The US stock market has been the gold standard for decades. But investors around the globe are growing increasingly nervous about the fallout from President Donald Trump’s economic agenda. That has sent traders in search of stocks in Europe and Asia. Wall Street has seen the largest drop in allocation to US stocks on record since data collection began in 1999, according to a Bank of America survey. Meanwhile, the survey showed the largest increase in allocation to European stocks since 2021. That’s in part because investors think US exceptionalism may have peaked, analysts at Bank of America wrote. After the benchmark S&P 500 soared over the past two years, some investors were already uncertain about prospects for another stand-out year. But now, Trump’s approach to trade and foreign policy is contributing to a broad shift in investors’ perception of the stability of US markets. “There seems to be a sea change in overall investor sentiment,” said David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation. The Dow on Friday edged higher by 32 points, or 0.08%. The broader S&P 500 gained 0.08% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.52%. The end-of-day rally helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq snap a four-week losing streak. The S&P 500 is down about 4% this year, lagging indexes around the globe that have all gained, including in China, Europe and Mexico. The US outlook wavers as Europe stabilizes Markets crave certainty and stability, and the US outlook is increasingly at odds with that picture, said Peter Ricchiuti, senior professor of finance at Tulane University’s Freeman School of Business. “The US has been [the place] everybody wanted to put money into,” he said. “And now it’s really upsetting the whole world in terms of clarity.” Recent data highlights that divergence: An index measuring US economic policy uncertainty by month spiked in March to its highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said in a statement that “uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased.” Ricchiuti said investors might be concerned about the impact of Trump’s policies toward tariffs and immigration on US economic growth. Major US companies are also signaling turmoil ahead. FedEx (FDX) slid 6.4% Friday after the parcel company slashed its guidance and lowered its forecast for profits this year. “Our revised earnings outlook reflects continued weakness and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy,” said John Dietrich, chief financial officer at FedEx Corporation, in a statement. “While we expected President Trump to make tariffs a key pillar of his policy agenda, the sheer size of the tariffs, coupled with a haphazard implementation plan, has created market turmoil and made it difficult for companies to plan for the future,” analysts at Baird said in a Thursday note. While investors are grappling with unease in the outlook for the US economy, the picture in Europe has emerged as relatively stable from an investment perspective. The Trump administration’s shift on foreign policy toward Ukraine has been a catalyst for Europe to focus on defense spending, boosting European stocks. In Germany, political change has propelled hopes for an economic transformation. Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz was successful in pushing through a historic plan for increased defense spending, providing a boost to forecasts for economic growth. “While this is being done in reaction to US policies, it offers compelling economic benefits for Germany,” said Kristina Hooper, chief investment strategist at Invesco, in a recent note. Germany’s DAX index has soared 15% this year. “The question is whether the Trump policy that’s slightly more isolationist actually unlocks kind of a new regime for investing internationally,” said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird.  \n",

      "She’s a two-time All American in 200- and 400-meter races. A college athlete used to winning, with a goal of making the 2032 US Olympic team. But 21-year-old Sadie Schreiner says she feels “defeated.” Not by the sport she loves or the physical rigors of the training but by the shifting rules on transgender athletes that have left her running alone around the track or now not running competitively at all. But she won’t stop. “I don’t know what would happen if I don’t have track and field, and I’m not going to see that reality,” Schreiner insisted. Schreiner knew when she was young that her physical body didn’t match her gender and began transitioning while in high school. She takes 8 pills daily to keep her testosterone levels low enough so they aren’t detectable on lab tests. “(The hormone therapy) shrank my ligaments. It’s made me shorter. It’s made me weaker. It’s lessened my muscles. It’s redistributing my fat. It’s lowered my lung capacity,” Schreiner explained. “My biology is fundamentally different than a cis man.” Her NCAA 24:12 personal best for the 200 meters puts her in the top tier of her age group but she said she’s a wholly different athlete than the high school kid who ran in boys’ races. “I am now 20% slower than I was in 8th grade.” Undetectable levels of testosterone used to be the standard to compete in NCAA competitions. Schreiner says she makes other accommodations too: “I don’t even change in the locker rooms.” But there’s nothing more she can do to run in college events – the competitive home of young US athletes – since the NCAA governing body followed President Donald Trump’s executive order titled “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports” with a rule change limiting participation in women’s sports to those assigned female at birth. She switched to meets organized by USA Track & Field – the national governing body for the sport – which holds competitions across the country for all ages and skill levels. It was the only place Schreiner was allowed to compete, isolated from her teammates and coaches. In some races, she ran around the track alone, with no competition in her age group, which she called “brutal.” “I am literally racing against me, instead of racing at these college meets, at the competitive levels I should be.” Schreiner’s support base is now largely limited to her parents and boyfriend Ace. Her dad, Greg Schreiner, said: “She’s in a completely different spot than she was prior to her transition … and (transgender athletes) all just get looped together in the same conversation. At a meet in Maine earlier this month, entrants alongside Schreiner included elementary and high school children and seniors. She ran the indoor track alone, in a different class to the others. Between her two races, Schreiner checked the USATF’s rules on transwomen competing. Two nights earlier she’d received an email stating she didn’t meet requirements for transgender athletes. Sure enough, the rules posted online had become more restrictive, matching regulations from World Athletics. Essentially, another ban was in effect. “They silently changed their policy,” she said. “It means there’s likely no more meets in the United States that I could run.” The impact was not lost on Greg Schreiner either. “It’s sad, you know, you want to be excited about and celebrate your kids. I love to watch Sadie run and thinking that this is potentially her last race in this country, you become melancholy,” he said. USATF didn’t respond to an email from CNN requesting clarification on when and why the policy changed.  \n",

      "A Colorado business owner called her immigration attorney in a panic this week, wrestling with a worry she never expected: If she travels abroad for a conference, could she end up getting deported? A woman from Cameroon who lives in the Midwest made a heartbreaking decision: Flying home for her father’s funeral would be too risky. An immigrant of Palestinian descent cancelled international travel plans — and worried that walking outside their New England home with a keffiyeh they’ve worn for years might no longer be safe. And a Canadian tattoo artist who lives in Washington state shared her fears on social media about an upcoming trip across the border. These four people have never met, and many details of their lives are different. But they share at least one thing in common. They are legal immigrants with green cards — documents deeming them lawful permanent residents of the United States. And they told CNN they’re still scared the Trump administration could kick them out of the country. Immigration lawyer LaToya McBean Pompy says this growing fear is the biggest issue she sees among her clients who have green cards. “They’ve never been afraid before,” she says, “but today, they’re afraid.” Why some green card holders say they’re worried About 12.8 million green card holders live in the United States, according to the latest estimates from the Office of Homeland Security Statistics. And some of them were taken by surprise when authorities detained a former student protest leader at New York’s Columbia University earlier this month. Mahmoud Khalil, who helped lead the school’s student protest movement demanding a ceasefire in Gaza, is married to a US citizen and had a green card. He isn’t facing any criminal charges, but Trump administration officials have accused him of inciting violence and supporting terrorism – claims Khalil’s attorneys and supporters deny. “I think the fact he happened to be a permanent resident underscored the vulnerability of all non-citizens in this country to a lot of people who hadn’t thought it through,” says David Leopold, an immigration attorney in Ohio and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. They’re scared about upcoming travel plans Marina Sinden, a green card holder in Washington state who’s married to a US citizen, is looking forward to visiting her family in Canada for Easter. But the 37-year-old tattoo artist says she’s not looking forward to what she fears might happen when she tries to return to her US home afterward. “I’m really concerned about making the crossing back into the United States. … I have an entire world here to lose if I’m not allowed to re-enter,” Sinden says. Escalating tensions between the US and Canada, plus a recent report of a Canadian woman who was detained at the border for 12 days, are weighing on her. “I’m very concerned about going through an experience like that,” Sinden says. “I own a home here. I own a brick-and-mortar business. I have vehicles. I have children in school. And I have a daughter who says the Pledge of Allegiance to the United States flag every single day.” Sinden says she worries a clerical error in her file from a past green card application could cause confusion, even though she resolved that problem in court, her current green card is valid and she has no criminal record. “I’m concerned that no matter what I’ve done to do the right things (and) respect the rules… I could have my entire life taken from me for a clerical issue … where something was misfiled one time incorrectly,” she says. The stress is something that’s difficult for those who haven’t dealt directly with the US immigration system to understand, says Maria, a 38-year-old business owner in Colorado. She asked to be identified only by her first name out of concern that speaking out could jeopardize her legal status in the US. Maria told CNN she came to the US from Costa Rica when she was 5 years old. She has a green card now, but as a child she was undocumented for years after her family overstayed their visas. “I remember feeling like we couldn’t go to the doctor, we couldn’t go do anything, because the fear of deportation was so real,” she says. “It’s terrible, and now, oh my God, all my childhood traumas and fears are being reignited and lived again — something I never thought I’d have to deal with ever again.” This week, as she prepared to put down a deposit to attend an important work conference abroad, Maria called her lawyer. Even with the green card she’s had for years, the situation feels increasingly uncertain, she says. “He told me, ‘It’s fine, you’re OK, you can go,’” she says. “But am I still scared? Yes.”  \n",

      "Isi: Every year when spring officially arrives, people spend more time in the great outdoors as the season gears up. Whether you’re looking for help identifying plants along your morning hike or designing the flower or food garden of your dreams, there is a mobile plant identification app that can help you.

      "“We are driven to identify plants for many reasons,” explains Erin C. Hill, Ph.D., an academic dpecialist in the Department of Plant, Soil and Microbial Sciences at Michigan State University (MSU). “Sometimes it is a curiosity about the world around us,” she writes, and at “other times it is out of the desire or need to manage areas like gardens, agricultural fields, restored habitats, and/or natural preserves.” Dr. Hill’s responsibilities include collaborating on plant and seed identification as a member of MSU’s Plant & Pest Diagnostics team.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her article, Dr. Hill discusses how plant identification apps for smartphones have seen “significant improvements” over the past several years, and how these apps offer folks “the opportunity to take a photo and get an instant identification in many cases.” With this in mind, we’ve tested five plant identification apps available on Android and iOS that you can use to quickly find out what plant you’re interested in, whether you’re hiking outdoors with loved ones or starting an indoor garden that you want your pets to be safe around.\n",

      "Wartawan: Rachel Dennis\n",
      "Isi: Plenty of skin care products promise to lift, firm, brighten and rejuvenate the skin, but what does it actually mean when a skin care product is said to be anti-aging? According to Dr. Rishi Chopra, a Harvard-trained, board-certified dermatologist at UnionDerm in New York City, anti-aging is chiefly viewed through the lens of collagen, which he explains is a fundamental part of our skin and the easiest for us to see clinically and under the microscope.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I think about anti-aging, at least from a skin care perspective, I’m looking at [the] ability of a skin care product to prevent the degradation of collagen or produce more collagen so that we can maintain that elasticity and the integrity of the skin,” Chopra says. “There’s a variety of ways that you can do that, and it depends on what the mechanism is, but that’s how I define it as a dermatologist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The key to keeping your skin looking as youthful as possible is to adopt good skin care practices sooner rather than later, Chopra says. “Skin care starts at home and it starts early. I tell patients that the earlier you start and the more that you do at home, the less you’ll have to do in the office,” he says. “In your teens and your 20s, you want to maximize your skin care routine at home and that should include the fundamentals — sunscreen, retinol, vitamin C, some type of collagen-boosting or brightening serum, a good cleanser and a moisturizer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "You don’t need to break the bank to curate an effective skin care routine either, the New York-based derm stresses, though if there’s one item worth the splurge, it’s sunscreen. “I do think it’s important to splurge on the right sunscreen because what we’re finding out more and more is that most of the sunscreen that you’re probably putting on your face isn’t protecting as much against aging as we think,” he says, adding that those sunscreens are great for preventing skin cancer but not the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want something that’s going to help prevent aging, he recommends looking for sunscreen with high UVA protection. He also recommends people with more melanated skin incorporate a tinted sunscreen into their skin care routine to prevent hyperpigmentation, since he says regular sunscreens do little to nothing to help. “That tint is not just a cosmetic camouflage; it’s a filter, and it also helps prevent aging as well,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Chopra notes, investing in the health of your skin or “skinvesting” early on, will pay off down the road both cosmetically and psychologically, whether you’re spending that money on an at-home skin care routine or a clinical procedure. In office, Chopra recommends investing in a resurfacing laser treatment and a wrinkle relaxer, like Jeuveau, which he describes as a newer version of Botox, to reduce the signs of aging.\n",

Kirin — a Japanese food giant whose products you’ve very likely consumed at some point — says it built the spoon in collaboration with various labs and universities, and based on surveys it performed with actual taste testers, says it can make foods taste roughly 1.5 times saltier.\n",

      "Wartawan: Rachel Dennis\n",
      "Isi: A supportive pillow can make all the difference when it comes to achieving a more restful night’s sleep, especially for those dealing with neck pain. In fact, investing in the right pillow now can help prevent discomfort and regret down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Leah Kaylor, a clinical and prescribing psychologist who specializes in sleep and trauma, people who suffer from chronic neck pain not only have a harder time falling asleep but a tougher time staying asleep. But that’s not all. Poor sleep can lead to a host of other problems that can negatively impact your general well-being. “When a person is consistently not getting good sleep, this leaves them vulnerable to memory problems, decreased attention span, brain fog, as well as mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "While pillows aren’t a magical solution (though we wish that were the case), they can offer some relief, which, in turn, can improve the quality of your sleep. “A well-designed pillow plays a crucial role in sleep posture and spinal alignment,” Kaylor says. “When you have a pillow that properly supports the head, it reduces the strain on the neck muscles and relieves pressure points. Not only does this enhance relaxation but it increases circulation and reduces pain-related awakenings. You are also less likely to wake up with morning stiffness, pain or inflammation by having proper support.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking for the right pillow for neck pain? We consulted several sleep and pain management specialists who shared their thoughts on what to look for when shopping for pillows, along with personal recommendations. Keep in mind that, ultimately, choosing the right pillow will depend on your own personal needs.\n",

Be it for binging shows, obsessing over sports or playing video games, it’s the focal point of my apartment and the gateway to so many things I enjoy.

      "\n",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a federal election in a widely anticipated move where he met with Governor-General Mary Simon on Sunday to request for Parliament to be dissolved.\n",
      "“I’m asking Canadians for a strong, positive mandate to deal with President [Donald] Trump and to build a new Canadian economy that works for everyone because I know we need change,” Carney said on Sunday of the ongoing trade war with the United States.\n",
      "The election will be held on April 28 and will see Carney face off against his main rival, the Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre.\n",
      "Carney assumed his role as Liberal leader and prime minister after his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, announced his resignation in January amid a polling slump and an internal revolt in his cabinet.\n",
      "For months, polls indicated that the Conservatives had a strong lead in the election. The Liberal Party has since seen a surge in popularity following a trade war with the US and Trump’s threat to Canada’s sovereignty.\n",
      "“We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump’s unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty,” Carney said Sunday. “Our response must be to build a strong economy and a more secure Canada.”\n",
      "He added: “President Trump claims that Canada isn’t a real country. He wants to break us so America can own us. We will not let that happen.”\n",
      "The Conservative leader Poilievre, who launched his campaign for the premiership on Sunday with a “Canada First” message, has repeatedly portrayed Carney as a leader ill-equipped to deal with Trump.\n",
      "During a press conference ahead of Carney announcing the poll, Poilievre said: “Today, the Liberals are asking for a fourth term in power after swapping Justin Trudeau for his economic adviser and handpicked successor, Mark Carney.”\n",
      "When asked how he would handle his relationship with Trump, Poilievre said he would insist the “independence and sovereignty of Canada” was recognized and “I will strengthen our country so that we can be capable of standing on our own two feet and standing up to the Americans where and when necessary.”\n",
      "Carney, in turn, has accused Poilievre of following Trump’s lead in suggesting Canada should cut its foreign aid budget. On Sunday, the prime minister suggested that Canada’s Conservatives mirror the Trump administration in “language” and “intent.”\n",
      "Carney was sworn in as Canada’s prime minister in March and was expected to call the election as he sought a mandate. Carney, who is the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, has emphasized his financial background as the future of the Canadian economy looks uncertain.\n",
      "During his address in Ottawa, the Liberal leader outlined his vision to reposition the Canadian economy.\n",
      "He said that after meeting with Canada’s provincial ministers on Friday, a “consensus” was reached to remove trade barriers within the country and unify the Canadian economy. He also promised to introduce a middle-class tax cut that he said would benefit dual-income families.\n",
      "Canada would continue to diversify its trade partners and lessen its reliance on the United States, he said. Carney also emphasized the need to “act dramatically and act rapidly to build an economy that’s strong for Canada” and “control what we can control.”\n",

      "Simone McCarthy\n",
      "\n",
      "China is practicing “dogfighting” satellites as part of its expanding capabilities in space, according to the United States Space Force, which warned that Washington’s key rivals are closing the technology gap as space becomes increasingly critical to security on Earth.\n",
      "The Space Force observed “five different objects in space maneuvering in and out and around each other in synchronicity and in control,” its vice chief of space operations Gen. Michael A. Guetlein said Tuesday at a defense conference.\n",
      "“That’s what we call dogfighting in space. They are practicing tactics, techniques, and procedures to do on-orbit space operations from one satellite to another,” Guetlein said, using a term that typically refers to close-range aerial combat between fighter jets.\n",
      "Guetlein referred to the US’ “near peers” as practicing these on-orbit maneuvers during remarks at the McAleese Defense Programs Conference in Arlington, Virginia. A US Space Force spokesperson later confirmed to CNN that Guetlein was referring to operations conducted by China, which were observed via commercially available information.\n",
      "While the purpose of such operations was not clear – and some experts question the use of the term – Guetlein’s comments come as analysts say a growing number of countries, including China, have sought to develop counterspace technologies.\n",
      "Such capabilities could enable a country to destroy or disable satellites, potentially allowing them to interrupt a rival military’s communications or operations like launching and detecting missiles. Such interference could also wreak havoc on global navigation systems used for everything from banking and cargo shipping to ambulance dispatch.\n",
      "The US has been closely watching China’s rapid rise as a space power in recent decades, not only through its ambitious lunar and deep-space exploration programs, but also what analysts describe as its deepening counterspace capabilities.\n",
      "In response to a question about China and Russia, Guetlein said they had developed “exquisite” capabilities. He cited the deployment of jammers to disrupt satellite signals, the ability to dazzle intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance satellites with lasers, as well as maneuvers involving grappling with a satellite and towing it to a different orbit.\n",
      "“This is the most complex and challenging strategic environment that we have seen in a long time, if not ever,” Guetlein said, adding that the force needs “capabilities to deter and, if necessary, defeat aggression” to “guarantee that the advantage is in our favor” into the future.\n",
      "Given the physical dynamics in space, the maneuvers described by Guetlein as “dogfighting” would look very different from those in the air between fighter jets, in this case involving satellites maneuvering around one another using propellant, experts say.\n",
      "Analysts have long been closely monitoring interactions between satellites and other objects in space. Typically referred to as “rendezvous and proximity operations,” these maneuvers can be used for peaceful operations like satellite maintenance or clearing debris – but could also allow countries to interfere with adversaries’ assets.\n",
      "“Close maneuvering around other satellites could suggest the development of a counterspace weapon because getting close to another satellite means you could potentially grab it, launch a net or projectile at it, or use an energy weapon, like a laser or jammer,” said Clayton Swope, deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington.\n",

      "Conor McGregor will run for the Irish presidency in elections later this year, the controversial former fighter said on Thursday, as he announced his candidacy for the largely ceremonial role on an anti-immigration stance.\n",
      "McGregor, who in recent years has emerged as a figurehead for the far-right in Ireland, said on social media that he would run for president to oppose a long-awaited new European Union migration pact aimed at sharing the burden of processing asylum claims more evenly across the bloc.\n",
      "“Who else will stand up to Government and oppose this bill?” he said in an Instagram post to his more than 46 million followers. “Any other Presidential candidate they attempt to put forward will be of no resistance to them. I will!”\n",
      "The post comes just days after McGregor, 36, appeared at the White House with Donald Trump on St. Patrick’s Day, where he became the latest European ally of the US president to promote anti-immigrant sentiment – drawing controversy and censure back home.\n",
      "“Ireland is at the cusp of potentially losing its Irishness,” McGregor said Monday, claiming the government had “abandoned the voices” of Irish people and that rural towns were being overrun by immigrants.\n",
      "Once the face of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, Dublin-born McGregor was the first fighter to hold two UFC belts simultaneously and, according to Forbes, was the world’s highest paid sports star in 2021.\n",
      "Despite several rumored comebacks, he hasn’t fought in the UFC since back-to-back defeats four years ago – and has become a hugely controversial figure in Ireland, dogged by accusations of sexual assault, which he has denied.\n",
      "In a January civil lawsuit, a woman accused McGregor of sexual battery during the 2023 NBA Finals in Miami. The incident was investigated by police at the time and the Miami-Dade state attorney declined to press charges against him. McGregor said the allegations were false.\n",
      "Last fall, a civil jury in Dublin awarded nearly 250,000 euros ($257,000) in damages to a woman who claimed McGregor had “brutally raped and battered” her in a hotel in Dublin in 2018. McGregor testified that the two had consensual sex and vowed to appeal the verdict.\n",
      "In recent years, McGregor has also turned his attention to sparring with people on social media. Political analysts and far-right experts have told CNN that McGregor’s unique brand of Irish patriotism that won him supporters as a fighter has mutated into a strand of “far-right” Irish nationalism.\n",
      "As far back as 2022, McGregor had expressed support for people protesting against immigration. Some Irish politicians have accused him of fanning the flames of discontent online, voicing his anger at Ireland’s immigration policy – a particularly sensitive issue given the country’s long history of emigration.\n",
      "Ireland, a country of just over 5 million people, saw 141,600 immigrants arrive in the year leading up to April 2023 – the highest figure in 16 years with some attracted by its strong economic performance, according to the Central Statistics Office Ireland.\n",

      "What Putin really wants, though, is much, much bigger.\n",
      "The Russian president has made no secret of the fact that he believes Ukraine should not exist as an independent state and he has repeatedly said he wants NATO to shrink back to its Cold War-era size.\n",
      "But more than anything, he wants to see a new global order — and he wants Russia to play the starring role in it.\n",
      "Putin and several of his most trusted allies emerged from the remnants of the KGB, the Soviet-era intelligence agency. They have never forgotten the humiliation of the fall of the Soviet Union and are not happy with the way the world has turned out since then.\n",
      "Putin rose to power during the chaos of the 1990s, when the Russian economy collapsed and had to be rescued by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – another humiliation for the former superpower.\n",
      "But from 2000, when Putin became president, steadily rising oil prices made Russia and many Russians richer than ever before. And Russia had a voice. It was invited into the G7 group of the world’s largest economies – renamed the G8 after it joined.\n",
      "But this was not enough for the Russian leader, Kristine Berzina, a managing director at the German Marshal Fund of United States, told CNN.\n",
      "“Putin was happy to throw all that away on behalf of his citizens because of higher geopolitical aims,” Berzina said. Russia was expelled from the G8, sanctioned by the West and ostracized on the global stage because of its aggression against Ukraine.\n",
      "Berzina said it was never good enough for Russia to be “the eighth in the G7.”\n",
      "“That doesn’t work within Russia’s understanding of its own exceptionalism. It is the largest country in the world, the richest in (natural) resources, so how can it simply be one of the players?” she said.\n",
      "To understand what Putin wants from the current talks with the US, it’s key to remember that the two sides are talking because the United States made a policy U-turn under Trump — not because of a fundamental change in Russian thinking.\n",
      "Trump wants the war in Ukraine to end as soon as possible, even if it means further territorial losses for Ukraine.\n",
      "This means Putin has little to lose from talking.\n",
      "Trump has claimed that “Russia holds all the cards” in the war with Ukraine, but the battlefield has been mostly stalled for the past two years.\n",
      "While Russia is making some incremental gains, it is definitely not winning – though this could change if the US was to stop supplying arms and intelligence to Ukraine.\n",
      "“Putin went into Ukraine thinking that it will be an easy, quick operation. Three years on, he controls 20% of Ukraine, but at terrible, terrible cost. I mean, essentially the Russians are losing. The thing though is that the Ukrainians are losing faster,” leading Russia analyst Mark Galeotti told CNN.\n",
      "For Putin and the people around him, Trump’s push for a ceasefire simply presents an opportunity to secure quick wins while keeping an eye on the long-term goals, he said.\n",
      "“Putin is an opportunist. He likes creating dynamic, chaotic situations, which throw up a whole variety of opportunities. And then he can then just pick which opportunity appeals to him, and he can change his mind,” Galeotti said.\n",

      "Saturday’s first departing flights took off from Heathrow at 6 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), according to the airport’s website. Almost all were listed as on time.\n",
      "British Airways said it expects to operate at around 85% capacity on Saturday, but cautioned that “to recover an operation of our size after such a significant incident is extremely complex.” It warned customers to expect delays.\n",

      "Friday’s shutdown was caused by a fire in an electrical substation in the town of Hayes, just a few miles from the airport, which disrupted the local power supply, throwing more than 1,000 flights into disarray and forcing pilots to divert their journeys in midair.\n",

      "The shutdown could affect around 150,000 passengers and inflict hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damages on the aviation industry, raising questions about Heathrow’s reliance on a single power source. The government says the national energy operator will investigate.\n",
      "But Thomas Woldbye, Heathrow’s chief executive, said he was “proud” of the airport’s response to the “unprecedented” crisis and claimed it is not unusual for airports to be so dependent on a sole source of energy.\n",

      "“All our backup systems were up and running. Our tower was running. Our runways were running as they should,” Woldbye told BBC Radio 4. “Whereas the safety systems are working and we can get aircraft in and out, most of the airport infrastructure comes to a standstill when we need to reset as we did yesterday.”\n",

While the airport is a key source of growth for the British economy, environmentalists and local activists have long opposed the disruption this would cause to the surrounding area. A third runway could increase the number of flights from its current cap of 480,000 a year to 720,000.\n",
      "Asked about the third runway and whether passengers can “trust” Heathrow, Woldbye said he has “full trust in the fact that we can build a third runway that is resilient,” and denied that the airport has been “complacent” about its preparedness for major incidents like Friday’s.\n",

      "President Donald Trump’s calls with President Vladimir Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky this week represent the most intense diplomacy aimed at ending the war in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion three years ago.\n",
      "Early signs are discouraging, since Putin refused to sign up for Trump’s proposal of a 30-day ceasefire. But Trump is framing the opening of any dialogue as a triumph. And each leader is trying to manipulate the diplomacy to their own ends and playing the public relations game – not least to escape blame if everything falls apart.\n",
      "The White House is spinning a fiction of significant progress both to keep alive the chances of a peace process developing and to support the increasingly tenuous conceit that Trump is a great dealmaker, uniquely able to forge peace.\n",
      "Putin flatly refused Trump’s big ask on the ceasefire. Quite simply, he’s not ready to end the war yet, as can be seen from a new set of conditions that Ukraine could never agree to if it is to survive as a sovereign state. But the Kremlin also doesn’t want to alienate Trump, and it offered him the tantalizing glimpse of a great power relationship with Putin to draw the president in.\n",
      "Zelensky is a quick learner. He can’t afford a repeat of the disastrous Oval Office blowup, and now readily agrees to almost everything Trump asks. Ironically, Zelensky’s meltdown-sparking argument – that Putin cannot be trusted to make or keep ceasefire agreements – has now been proven true.\n",
      "Ukraine and Russia are each vying for the president’s attention and seeking to blame the other for impeding peace. After a violent night, each side accused the other of breaking the partial agreement brokered by the US president to avoid hitting energy infrastructure. Their estrangement over even this minor detail undermines Trump’s bullish statements that a peace deal is within reach.\n",
      "The White House has publicly ignored Putin’s intransigence, praising the tone of his call with Trump on Tuesday and scheduling technical talks with the Russians in Saudi Arabia in the coming days.\n",
      "Creating an illusion of progress can be an important aspect of peace negotiations, offering an incentive for warring sides to stay at the table. But in this case, the alternate reality seems also intended to spare the blushes of a president who predicted he’d solve the war within 24 hours if voters sent him back to the White House. In their phone call on Tuesday, Putin clearly got the better of a US president who is unwilling to impose any leverage on the Kremlin strongman.\n",
      "On the other hand, Trump seems to have eased up on Zelensky, perhaps because of the Ukrainian president’s more flattering tone. He agreed in their hourlong call Wednesday to help locate vitally needed air defense equipment for Ukraine in Europe. And White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US would continue to provide military aid and intelligence to Ukraine. This is important because Trump cut off such assistance to force Kyiv to come to the table on his 30-day ceasefire plan. And it’s a rare rebuke to Putin, who made the halting of US military and intelligence resources for Ukraine a condition of joining a quest for permanent peace.\n",
      "“Just completed a very good telephone call with President Zelensky of Ukraine. It lasted approximately one hour,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs. We are very much on track.” Trump’s bullish assessment was almost absurdly upbeat. But it’s better than a few weeks ago when he was calling Zelensky a “dictator.”\n",
      "After his calls with Putin and Zelensky, Trump’s dream of a peace deal seems further away than ever. Still, if all this week’s drama is somehow the start of a real push to conjure a fair and permanent settlement, Trump will prove his doubters wrong.\n",

      "Before the truce, Israel and Hezbollah exchanged cross-border attacks for 13 months in the wake of the Gaza conflict. Israel launched an intense ground and aerial campaign in September last year, decimating the Iran-backed militant group’s leadership.\n",

      "Jihad Suleiman Al-Sawafta, 46, has lived on his farm in the occupied West Bank village of Bardala his entire life. But when Israeli settlers showed up in December, Al-Sawafta said his land, and his livelihood, shrank to a fraction of its former self.\n",
      "“The settlers brought another settler here and placed him in our area. The Israelis built a road that separates us from grazing and agricultural areas, and the settlers don’t allow us to farm on them,” he told CNN.\n",
      "“They crowded the area. They took thousands of dunams (1,000 square meters) from Bardala and its grazing lands,” he said, referring to his Palestinian town in the northern part of the West Bank. He added that the Jordan Valley, a fertile strip of land long considered the West Bank’s breadbasket, had been “largely emptied”of its Palestinian residents.\n",
      "Israeli forces were overseeing the paving of a new road during CNN’s visit in late January. Al-Sawafta said the military maintains a 24-hour presence, providing security for settlers, making it dangerous for him to cross and tend the crops he planted in nearby fields.\n",
      "Responding to a request for comment about the situation in Bardala, the Israeli military told CNN that the status of the outpost had not changed, and that the new road was intended for security forces, paved in accordance with a military order. “Palestinians living in the area were not harmed during the work,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.\n",
      "Herding outposts like the one set up on Al-Sawafta’s land are often established by Israeli settlers on hilltops with a few caravans and sometimes livestock to mark their claim. Monitoring groups say they are notorious for swallowing up vast swathes of land and prohibiting Palestinian residents from moving freely. The outposts are illegal under both Israeli and international law, and the state is not allowed to finance or build on them.\n",
      "The number of Israeli herding outposts has dramatically increased since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right coalition took power in 2022 on a platform of settlement expansion. The government includes ministers who are themselves settlers and want to annex the occupied territory to Israel. In the wake of the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023, which triggered Israel’s invasion of Gaza, settlers have accelerated land grabs with support from the state.\n",
      "Israeli herding outposts have ballooned by nearly 50% since the war broke out, according to a joint report shared exclusively with CNN by Peace Now and Kerem Navot, two Israeli advocacy groups that oppose settlements and track their development, covering data up to the end of December 2024.\n",
      "Settlers established 49 new illegal shepherding outposts between October 7, 2023, and December 2024, seizing large swathes of surrounding land, according to the report which was corroborated by a CNN analysis of satellite imagery of the area.\n",
      "CNN partnered with the US artificial intelligence company RAIC Labs to monitor the establishment and expansion of new outposts in the West Bank. RAIC Labs used its AI-powered platform to analyze and compare satellite imagery of the West Bank captured by Planet Labs in October 2023 and September 2024, identifying changes in the 49 outposts such as newly constructed structures, recently cleared areas, and emerging roads, which were manually verified by CNN.\n",
      "Peace Now and Kerem Navot estimate that shepherding outposts, occupied by a few hundred settlers, now cover almost 14% of the West Bank. Some of the unauthorized outposts are run by extremist Israeli settlers and settler groups that were sanctioned under the Biden administration, according to the monitoring groups.\n",
      "Of the total land seized by settlers in the West Bank since the 1990s using herding outposts, 70% has been taken in the last two and half years alone, the report found.\n",
      "“It’s important to understand that the herding outposts are a national project, a state project. This is not a project which is initiated by individuals, it’s a project which the state of Israel is standing behind, is budgeting for, is facilitating, is protecting,” Dror Etkes, founder of Kerem Navot and co-author of the report, told CNN.\n",
      "CNN reached out to several members of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, for comment on the practice, but none agreed to an interview. CNN also requested comment from the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, but did not receive a response.\n",
      "The IDF told CNN that its “top priority was to ensure the security of all residents in the area.” It added that, through the Civil Administration, it works to enforce against illegal structures in Area C, which comprises about 60% of the West Bank and is fully Israeli-controlled, “in accordance with the operational situation assessment and with approval from the political echelon.”\n",

      "“As part of the ground activities, the troops expanded their control further to the center of the Netzarim Corridor,” the military said, referring to a key Israeli-demarcated strip of land that splits Gaza in half, dividing the central Gaza City and northern Gaza from the southern parts of the strip that borders Egypt.\n",
      "Hamas called the latest offensive a “new and dangerous breach” of the ceasefire agreement. The militant group, in a statement Wednesday, said it remained committed to the ceasefire agreement it signed with Israel in January.\n",

      "The vote to dismiss Bar in the early hours of Friday local time was appealed just hours later by Israel’s Supreme Court.\n",
      "“The government has now unanimously approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s proposal to terminate the term of Shin Bet head Ronen Bar,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement Friday.\n",
      "“Ronen Bar will end his role as Shin Bet head on April 10, 2025, or when a permanent Shin Bet head is appointed – whichever comes first,” it added.\n",
      "That vote came after Netanyahu met with Bar last week and informed him that he would propose his removal.\n",
      "In a video statement released on Sunday, Netanyahu said his “ongoing distrust” of Bar had led to the move. “At all times, but especially in such an existential war, the prime minister must have full confidence in the head of the Shin Bet,” Netanyahu said.\n",

      "Ekrem Imamoglu, Erdogan’s most serious political rival, was arrested at his home on Wednesday just days before he was to be registered as a candidate in the 2028 presidential election. He was formally charged Sunday and detained pending trial.\n",
      "Imamoglu has denied the charges against him and critics say the arrest represents a dangerous turning point for Turkey which, after years of slow-burn authoritarianism, risks becoming a full-blown autocracy.\n",
      "“We will, hand in hand, uproot this blow, this black stain on our democracy… I am standing tall, I will not bow down,” Imamoglu said on X.\n",
      "After tens of thousands this week took to the streets in more than a dozen cities to protest Imamoglu’s arrest, Turkish police have begun to hit back, arresting more than 300 people overnight into Saturday.\n",
      "Speaking outside the Istanbul courtroom on Sunday, Dilek Imamoglu, the mayor’s wife, said the decision to jail him was politically motivated.\n",
      "“Our conscience is clear, our head is held high. The decision that was taken unjustly, illegally, has no aspect of justice. All the decisions taken are political,” she said.\n",
      "Immamoglu was one of 45 people detained as part of the corruption investigation, CNN Turk reported Sunday, including the mayor of Beylikduzu, Mehmet Murat Calik. Later, the Interior Ministry removed Imamoglu and Calik from their mayoral duties.\n",
      "The first move against Imamoglu, the highly popular mayor of Istanbul for the opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), centered on whether his university degree is valid. Istanbul University said Tuesday it had annulled his degree over irregularities, effectively barring him from running for president.\n",
      "But the charges against Imamoglu have since swelled into something far greater. Imamoglu and some 100 others associated with him have now been accused of belonging to a criminal group, extortion, bribery and aggravated fraud, according to the Istanbul prosecutor’s office, state media Anadolu reported.\n",
      "Sunday’s order does not relate to a separate investigation over allegedly aiding the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Turkey considers a terrorist organization.\n",

      "Mansur Yavas, the mayor of Ankara, said he had come to the courthouse “without sleeping” and that he was “ashamed” of Turkey’s justice system.\n",
      "Imamoglu’s supporters have decried his detention as politically motivated and an attempt by Erdogan to take revenge for the punishing defeat of his Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in local and mayoral elections last year.\n",
      "Some see a personal element to Erdogan’s grudge. Once mayor of Istanbul himself, the CHP has now won three consecutive mayoral elections against Erdogan’s party in Turkey’s biggest city, each by a greater margin than the last.\n",
      "“We are up against huge bullying,” Imamoglu said after his initial arrest earlier this week. “But I will not back down.”\n",
      "Erdogan extended his rule into a third decade after winning 2023’s knife-edge presidential election. The next vote is not for three years, but some analysts say Erdogan could call for early elections that would allow him to bypass term limits.\n",
      "Murat Somer, politics professor at Ozyegin University in Istanbul, said Imamoglu’s detention showed Turkey was undergoing a political transformation from “an open autocratic regime to a Russian- or Belarussian-style, fully authoritarian, autocratic regime.”\n",
      "Erdogan has dismissed opposition anger as “theatrics” and “slogans” for which Turkey has no time. The president warned late Saturday that “no one in Turkey is outside the scope of the law,” and said his government – now facing mass protests – will “not allow CHP and its supporters to disrupt public order with provocations and disturb the peace of our nation.”\n",
      "Members of the CHP voted Sunday in the party’s primary election to determine its presidential candidate for 2028. Imamoglu is the sole candidate in the primary.\n",
      "In an effort to garner support for the jailed political leader, the CHP leader Ozgur Ozel also called on non-party members to vote through a “solidarity ballot box” and called on supporters to continue protesting Imamoglu’s arrest.\n",
      "“Though Ekrem İmamoğlu is currently on the road to prison, in another sense he is also on the road to presidency,” Ozel said Sunday night while at Istanbul City Hall in Sarachane. “The nation is repelling a coup through solidarity ballot boxes.”\n",

      "Pope Francis will be discharged on Sunday from the hospital where he has spent more than a month being treated for double pneumonia, Dr. Sergio Alfieri, the head of the team taking care of the pontiff, announced.\n",
      "“The Holy Father will be discharged from tomorrow in stable clinical condition with a prescription to partially continue drug therapy and a convalescence and rest period of at least two months,” Alfieri told reporters at a news conference at Gemelli on Saturday.\n",
      "“Today we are happy to say that tomorrow he will be at home,” he added.\n",
      "The pontiff will also make his first public appearance on Sunday at the hospital’s balcony before making his way back to the Casa Santa Marta, his residence since the 2013 conclave, according to Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni.\n",
      "Francis, who has been in hospital since February 14, has recovered from double pneumonia, but not all of the infections he has been suffering from, according to Dr. Luigi Carbone, the vice-director of the Vatican’s healthcare service.\n",
      "The pope’s voice is improving but he still needs time to recover, he added.\n",
      "The 88-year-old pontiff will continue the therapy and physiotherapy after he has been discharged, Carbone added.\n",
      "Francis will offer a blessing and greeting to well-wishers at the end of Sunday’s Angelus prayer, the Vatican press office said earlier on Saturday. Francis usually leads the prayer and offers a reflection each week, but has not done so for the past five Sundays.\n",
      "Catholic worshippers from Vatican City to Argentina, where Francis is from, celebrated the news.\n",
      "Many gathered at St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City on Saturday night to pray for the pope as they have been doing since his hospitalization. But today their prayers were mixed with relief.\n",
      "“It’s a great joy for all of us, for all the faithful, for all of us who’ve come here each evening to pray,” Richard Gundel, one of the worshippers, told Reuters at the square. “Now we’ve received wonderful news, a great joy.”\n",
      "In Argentina’s capital, a video showed a framed photograph of the pope at a Buenos Aires church on Saturday as worshippers attended a mass to pray for his health.\n",
      "“When I heard the news today, it gave me goosebumps,” one of the worshippers Raquel Martinez told Reuters outside the church with a big smile on her face. “I was so moved, it’s something indescribable.”\n",
      "The pope’s hospitalization has been his longest stay in Gemelli since his election 12 years ago. While he has not been seen in weeks, his presence has been felt with the Vatican releasing a short audio message from the pope as well as a photo last weekend showing him praying at that hospital’s chapel.\n",
      "Since the pope’s admission to the hospital mid-February, there were two serious episodes were his life was in danger, according to the Vatican and the team taking care of the pontiff.\n",
      "Carbone told reporters at the hospital news conference on Saturday that the pope is in good spirits and has been asking to be discharged for the last few days.\n",
      "News of his discharge comes after the Vatican said this week that the Pope’s condition appeared to be improving, adding that his pneumonia is considered under control.\n",
      "Last week, the pope approved a new three-year reform process for the Catholic Church, sending a strong signal he intends to remain in the post despite his lengthy stint in hospital.\n",
      "Reforms on the table include how to give greater roles to women in the Catholic Church, including ordaining them as deacons, and the greater inclusion of non-clergy members in governance and decision making.\n",

      "The attack on the facility in Sudzha comes just days after the US proposed both sides pause attacks on energy infrastructure.\n",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry claimed Kyiv had “deliberately attacked” the station, which has been under Ukrainian control since Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Kursk in August 2024.\n",
      "Moscow claims Ukrainian forces blew up the facility while “retreating from the Kursk region” with the aim of “discrediting the US president’s peace initiatives.”\n",
      "On Saturday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry further warned that it “reserves the right to respond, including with a symmetrical response” to what it claims were Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy infrastructure facilities.\n",
      "Kyiv has described those accusations as “groundless” and claimed they are aimed at discrediting Ukraine and misleading the international community.\n",
      "“Indeed, the station has been repeatedly shelled by the Russians themselves,” Ukraine’s General Staff said in a Telegram post on Friday.\n",
      "According to the Ukrainian military, Russia struck the same station with missiles as recently as three days ago.\n",
      "“The attempts by the Russians to deceive everyone and pretend that they are adhering to the ceasefire will not work, (neither) will the fake news about the strikes on the gas station,” Ukraine’s Presidential Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak posted on X Friday.\n",
      "The Sudzha gas metering station was the last route through which Russian natural gas was delivered to Europe through Ukraine. Natural gas transportation through Sudzha was terminated on the morning of January 1, 2025, after Kyiv refused to renew the contract.\n",
      "The attack on the station comes more than a week after the announcement by Russian forces that they had recaptured Sudzha, the largest town that Ukraine has occupied during its incursion into Kursk. Ukraine’s occupation of parts of Kursk is seen as its sole territorial bargaining chip amid pressure to negotiate an end to the war.\n",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to temporarily halt attacks on energy targets in Ukraine after a lengthy telephone call with President Donald Trump on Tuesday, though he stopped short of signing off on a broader ceasefire to end the three-year-long conflict in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also said he would support a pause on striking energy targets.\n",

      "Sudan’s army is close to taking control of the Presidential Palace in Khartoum from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, state TV reported on Thursday, in a significant milestone in a two-year-old conflict that threatens to fracture the country.\n",
      "The RSF quickly took the palace and most of the capital at the outbreak of war in April 2023, but the Sudanese Armed Forces have in recent months staged a comeback and inched towards the palace along the River Nile.\n",
      "The RSF, which earlier this year began establishing a parallel government, maintains control of parts of Khartoum and neighboring Omdurman, as well as western Sudan, where it is fighting to take control of the army’s last stronghold in Darfur, al-Fashir.\n",
      "The taking of the capital could hasten the army’s full takeover of central Sudan, and harden the east-west territorial division of the country between the two forces.\n",
      "Both sides have vowed to continue fighting for the remainder of the country, and no efforts at peace talks have materialized.\n",
      "The war erupted amid a power struggle between Sudan’s army and the RSF ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule.\n",
      "The conflict has led to what the UN calls the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, causing famine in several locations and disease across the country. Both sides have been accused of war crimes, while the RSF has also been charged with genocide. Both forces deny the charges.\n",
      "The fight for the Presidential Palace has raged over the past several weeks, with the RSF fighting fiercely to maintain control, including via snipers placed around surrounding downtown buildings. Its leader, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, instructed troops earlier this week not to give up the palace.\n",
      "Late on Wednesday into Thursday morning, explosions could be heard from airstrikes and drone attacks by the army targeting central Khartoum, witnesses and military sources told Reuters. The army has long maintained the advantage of air power over the RSF, though the paramilitary group has shown evidence of increased drone capabilities recently.\n",
      "On the Telegram messenger app, the RSF said its forces were making advances towards the Army General Command, also in central Khartoum, and eyewitnesses said the force was attacking from southern Khartoum.\n",
      "The army’s advance in central Sudan since late last year has been welcomed by many people, who had been displaced by the RSF, which has been accused of widespread looting and arbitrary killings, and of occupying homes and neighborhoods.\n",
      "The RSF denies the charges and says individual perpetrators will be brought to justice.\n",

      "Thousands of Turks ramped up protests on Thursday despite a ban on street gatherings over what they called the undemocratic detention of Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, as the opposition sought to pin the blame on President Tayyip Erdogan.\n",
      "Protestors gathered at a municipal headquarters and police station in Istanbul, and at universities and public squares across the country, leading to some scuffles with police officers who had erected barricades and closed off streets.\n",
      "Imamoglu, 54, Erdogan’s main political rival, was taken in on Wednesday facing charges of graft and aiding a terrorist group, a move that the opposition condemned as a “coup attempt” and that sparked an initial round of demonstrations and criticism from European leaders.\n",
      "The move against the popular two-term mayor caps a months-long legal crackdown on opposition figures that has been criticized as a politicized attempt to hurt their electoral prospects and silence dissent, charges the government denies.\n",
      "Erdogan, in his first comments on the detention, dismissed opposition criticism as “theatrics” and “slogans” for which the country had no time.\n",
      "In an interview, Ozgur Ozel, chairman of the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) that includes Imamoglu, said Erdogan feared facing the mayor in a vote and wanted to “take him out of the game” and cut his party’s ties with the city.\n",
      "He said that any move barring Imamoglu from running for president in the next election would only strengthen the opposition’s support, adding the CHP will appoint him its candidate on Sunday at a scheduled vote.\n",
      "“We believe Imamoglu will win. If his candidacy is blocked, we believe this will turn into much greater support,” Ozel told Reuters in his first interview with foreign media since the detention.\n",
      "“This nation has never forgiven anyone trying to lift the legitimacy of the ballots,” he said next to a small room at the Istanbul municipality headquarters - with crowds gathering outside - where he intends to overnight until Imamoglu is released.\n",

      "The Kremlin is keeping tight-lipped on the US peace plan, but with Ukraine signed up to the ceasefire, the pressure is now on Moscow to decide if it will also accept President Donald Trump’s proposals to bring the Ukraine war to a halt, albeit a temporary one.\n",
      "On his daily media call, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, refused to be drawn on the issue, saying that the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz are first expected to brief Moscow about the terms of the ceasefire, which were set out at US Ukrainian talks in Saudi Arabia earlier this week.\n",
      "“Rubio and Walz stated that they would provide us with detailed information about the essence of the conversations that took place in Jeddah through various diplomatic channels. First, we must receive this information. We also have contacts with the Americans planned for these days, during which we expect to have complete information,” Peskov told reporters.\n",
      "For Moscow, this is fast becoming a pivotal moment of truth and one which may require awkward compromises if it is serious about peace.\n",
      "The Kremlin has long claimed to be open to negotiations to end the conflict, while always insisting it must achieve its ambitious war aims, such as securing control over all annexed areas of Ukraine.\n",
      "Only last week, Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin strongman who launched this brutal war three years ago, vowed to a group of tearful widows and mothers of killed Russian soldiers, that Moscow would never “give in.”\n",
      "Most Russians, fatigued by the conflict and anxious about its dire economic impact, may be keen to see the fight end, which could result in biting sanctions being eased. But pro-war Russian hardliners, at times encouraged by the Kremlin, will see any early ceasefire as a betrayal.\n",
      "But a climbdown of some sort may be inevitable.\n",
      "Even if Russian negotiators can impose their own conditions on the ceasefire – a Ukrainian withdrawal from Kursk, for example, the small pocket of Russia captured by Ukraine, where fighting is now raging – it is hard to imagine that its greater territorial demands, yet alone the goal of removing NATO from its western flank, would be met.\n",
      "Likewise, there may some acceptance of any Russian calls for limitations on Ukrainian long-range weaponry. But as this stage, demands for the demilitarization of Ukraine, a stated Russian war aim, are likely to be seen as a step too far.\n",
      "The Kremlin’s response is also a moment of truth for the oddly warm Putin-Trump relationship.\n",
      "For weeks, Russians have reveled, gleefully, in America’s apparent shift in their favor, a move that has bewildered Washington’s traditional Western allies.\n",
      "The two countries are engaged in significant talks aimed at rebuilding economic and diplomatic ties, most recently an agreement was reached between the CIA and the Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVR, to reduce confrontation between Moscow and Washington, according to an SVR statement.\n",
      "Even Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov – until recently a harsh critic of Washington – has welcomed the fresh US stance toward Moscow.\n",
      "“I think what is going on in the United States is a return to normalcy,” he told US bloggers when asked whether the US had changed since Trump’s second inauguration.\n",
      "But in exchange for all the courting, concessions and praise, Trump may now expect the Kremlin leader to play ball – or risk his wrath.\n",
      "Indeed, “the ball is now in their court,” is precisely what US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said of the Russians after his talks with Ukrainian officials concluded in Jeddah. On Wednesday, the top US diplomat suggested that Moscow is “probably processing” the news of the temporary truce “the same as the rest of the world.”\n",

      "Trump’s comments come after he announced last week that Ukraine had accepted a US-proposed 30-day ceasefire, putting the ball in Russia’s court as to whether it would accept his proposal to swiftly end the war.\n",
      "“We’re doing pretty well, I think, with Russia. We’ll see if we have something to announce maybe by Tuesday, I’ll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday,” he told reporters on board Air Force One during a flight back to the White House after his weekend at Mar-a-Lago.\n",
      "“A lot of work’s been done over the weekend, we want to see if we can bring that war to an end,” he said. “Maybe we can, maybe we can’t, but I think we have a very good chance.”\n",

      "Putin’s response so far to the Trump-backed ceasefire proposal has been ambiguous. He said that Moscow agreed with the proposal in theory.

      "US military officials are scrambling to develop a “Golden Dome” defense system that can protect the country from long-range missile strikes and have been told by the White House that no expense will be spared in order to fulfill one of President Donald Trump’s top Pentagon priorities, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n",
      "“Golden Dome” is the Trump administration’s attempt to rebrand vague plans for developing a missile defense system akin to Israel’s Iron Dome.\n",
      "At a time the Pentagon is looking to cut budgets, the Trump administration has ordered military officials to ensure future funding for “Golden Dome” is reflected in new budget estimates for 2026 to 2030 – but the system itself remains undefined beyond a name, the sources said.\n",
      "“Right now, Golden Dome is, it’s really an idea,” one source familiar with internal discussions about the project said, adding there may be technology in the pipeline that, if ever scaled up, could apply to it, but as of now discussions are purely conceptual.\n",
      "That makes projecting future costs nearly impossible, the source added, though it would likely cost billions of dollars to construct and maintain.\n",
      "Trump has repeatedly insisted the US needs a missile defense program similar to Israel’s Iron Dome, but the systems are orders of magnitude apart. In practical terms, the comparison is less apples to oranges, and more apples to aircraft carriers.\n",
      "Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system selectively protects populated areas from short-range threats in a country the size of New Jersey; Trump wants a space-based missile defense system capable of defending the entire United States from advanced ballistic and hypersonic missiles.\n",
      "For one thing, “Israel is tiny,” the source familiar with ongoing internal discussions about the Golden Dome project said. “So, it is 100% feasible to blanket Israel in things like radars and a combination of mobile and fixed interceptors.”\n",
      "“How are you going to do that in the United States? You can’t do it just at the borders and the shoreline, because intercontinental ballistic missiles, they can re-enter the atmosphere over Kansas.”\n",
      "Still, Trump issued an executive order during his first week in office ordering Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to submit a plan for developing and implementing the next-generation missile defense shield by March 28.\n",
      "And a senior Pentagon official insisted earlier this week that work is underway.\n",

Morani, currently performing the duties of undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment said this week at the McAleese Defense Programs Conference in Washington.\n",
      "At the same time, Pentagon officials have been realigning the Defense Department’s 2026 budget proposal to meet Hegseth’s priorities, which were outlined in a memo delivered to senior leaders last week and represents a major overhaul of the military’s strategic goals, according to a copy obtained by CNN.\n",
      "The memo specifically directs Pentagon leadership to focus on strengthening missile defense of the US homeland through Trump’s “Golden Dome.”\n",
      "“There is a rigorous analytic process underway taking a relook at [the budget],” Morani added. “This is standard practice for any new administration that takes office.”\n",
      "But it remains unclear how much money the Pentagon will request for Trump’s Golden Dome in its budget proposal or how officials will determine the amount of funding is required.\n",
      "Retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery believes creating a ballistic missile defense system may be possible in 7-10 years, but even then, it will have severe limitations, potentially capable of protecting only critical federal buildings and major cities.\n",
      "“The more you want it closer to 100%, the more expensive it’s going to get,” said Montgomery, the senior director of the Center On Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n",
      "A comprehensive system will require different sets of satellites for communication, sensing incoming missiles, and launching interceptors, Montgomery told CNN. Those types of systems are long-term projects, he said, requiring existing defenses to fill the gap in the meantime.\n",
      "“You’ve gotta be responsible here,” Montgomery said. “You’re not going to be able to defend everything with these ground-based missiles. They defend a circle around them, but it’s not large.”\n",

      "The biggest obstacle to resolving Russia’s war in Ukraine is the status of Crimea and the four mainland Ukrainian regions occupied by Russia, said US special envoy Steve Witkoff, calling them “the elephant in the room” in peace talks.\n",
      "In a long interview with podcast host Tucker Carlson, Witkoff – who also revealed Russia’s President Putin had commissioned a portrait of Donald Trump and sent it to him – said the administration was making progress “that no one thought was possible” with Russia, but that issues of territory still need ironing out.\n",
      "The four mainland regions, which Witkoff appeared to struggle to name and needed prompting from Carlson, were illegally annexed during Russia’s full-scale invasion and Kyiv vehemently opposes giving them up.\n",
      "The Kremlin has since staged referenda on joining Russia in Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, which Kyiv and the international community decried as a propaganda exercise, but which Witkoff claimed was evidence of their desire to split from Ukraine.\n",
      "“They’re Russian-speaking,” Witkoff said of the four eastern regions. “There have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule.”\n",
      "Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy who also plays a key role in talks with Russia, said the “constitutional issues within Ukraine as to what they can concede… with regard to territory” had become “the elephant in the room” during negotiations. Talks are set to resume Monday in Saudi Arabia, with US officials set to meet officials from both Russia and Ukraine.\n",
      "“The Russians are de facto in control of these territories. The question is: Will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?” Witkoff asked. “Can (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky survive politically if he acknowledges this? This is the central issue in the conflict.”\n",
      "Zelensky stressed last weekend that Ukraine’s position “is that we do not recognize the occupied Ukrainian territories as Russian.”\n",
      "The US raised the issue during talks with Ukrainian delegates in the Saudi city of Jeddah, Zelensky said, adding that he hopes the question can be resolved during later peace talks, rather than discussions over an initial ceasefire. “It is dragging out the process for a long, long time,” he said.\n",
      "Witkoff said he was impressed by how “gracious” the Russian leader has been during the pair’s discussions, praising him as “smart” and “straightforward.”\n",
      "Before meeting Putin in Moscow, Witkoff said someone in the Trump administration warned him to “watch it, because he’s an ex-KGB guy,” referring to Putin’s former career in the Soviet Union’s security agency.\n",
      "Witkoff said he downplayed the person’s fears, saying Putin’s background in the agency was a measure of his intelligence. “In the old days, the only people who went into the KGB were the smartest people in the nation… He’s a super smart guy,” he recalled saying.\n",
      "“I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy,” Witkoff said, saying it was “gracious” of the Russian leader to receive him in Moscow for talks earlier this month.\n",
      "That meeting “got personal,” he said, recalling how Putin “had commissioned a beautiful portrait of President Trump from the leading Russian artist,” which Witkoff took home to the president.\n",
      "Witkoff said also that, following the assassination attempt against Trump in September, Putin said that he “went to his local church and met with his priest and prayed” for Trump, “not because he… could become the president of the United States, but because he had a friendship with him.”\n",
      "Trump was “clearly touched” by Putin’s story and the portrait, Witkoff said.\n",
      "Witkoff implied that resolving the war in Ukraine could lead to cooperation on a broader range of issues, and that the two sides were thinking about “integrating their energy policies in the Arctic,” sharing sea lanes, collaborating on artificial intelligence and sending liquefied natural gas “into Europe together.”\n",

      "Self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate is back in Romania along with his brother Tristan to report to the police, following a trip to Florida that triggered a state-level criminal probe.\n",
      "The online celebrity, who has amassed a massive following peddling sexist content about male dominance, is facing charges over human trafficking and forming an organized criminal group with his brother in Romania. They have denied all wrongdoing.\n",
      "The pair, both dual British and American citizens, left Romania late last month after prosecutors lifted a travel ban on them. They flew to Florida, only to find themselves subject to a new criminal investigation by state authorities there.\n",
      "They spoke to reporters Saturday after returning to Romania.\n",
      "“We’re here to clear our names and exonerate ourselves,” Andrew Tate said, speaking outside his house in Bucharest.\n",
      "“After all we’ve been through, we truly deserve the day in court where it is stated that we’ve done nothing wrong and that we should never be in court in the first place.”\n",
      "He referred to allegations against them as “garbage.”\n",
      "The Tates are required to regularly check in with police. Their next check-in is due on March 24, according to Reuters.\n",
      "Earlier Friday, Andrew Tate posted a picture of the pair on the flight, saying: “Innocent men don’t run. THEY CLEAR THEIR NAME IN COURT.”\n",

      "Romanian authorities arrested the brothers in December 2022 and placed them under police custody. They were later placed under house arrest.\n",
      "Prosecutors in the eastern European nation accused them of forming an organized criminal group that stretched across the country, as well as the United Kingdom and the US, trafficking women and sexually exploiting them with physical violence and coercion.\n",
      "Andrew Tate is also accused of raping one of the alleged victims. Separately, the two faced an investigation into allegations of human trafficking of minors and sex with a minor lodged against the brothers.\n",
      "Andrew and Tristan Tate have denied all allegations of wrongdoing, with Andrew writing on X that the brothers “have always been innocent.”\n",
      "Days after they arrived in Florida late last month, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced an active criminal investigation into the brothers, led by the Office of Statewide Prosecution. Florida has “zero tolerance for people who abuse women and girls,” he added.\n",
      "The brothers’ defense attorney accused Uthmeier of throwing “ethics law out of the window.”\n",
      "The brothers are also being investigated for allegations of rape and human trafficking in the UK, where they have also denied wrongdoing.\n",
      "Andrew Tate also faces a civil suit there by four women, accusing him of rape and coercive control.\n",
